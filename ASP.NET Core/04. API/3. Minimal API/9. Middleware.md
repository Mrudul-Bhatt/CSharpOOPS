Sure! Let's delve into the key points of the article "Middleware in Minimal API apps" on Microsoft Docs for ASP.NET Core:

### Middleware in Minimal API Apps

#### Overview:
Middleware in ASP.NET Core minimal API apps are components that process HTTP requests and responses in a pipeline. Each piece of middleware can perform operations before and after the next component in the pipeline. Middleware can handle cross-cutting concerns such as logging, authentication, authorization, error handling, and more.

#### Key Points:

1. **Middleware Order:**
   - The order in which middleware components are added to the pipeline is crucial because it determines the order in which they process requests and responses.
   - Middleware components are added in the `Program.cs` file using the `Use` extension method.
   - The order is significant because each middleware can short-circuit the pipeline, preventing subsequent middleware from running.

   ```csharp name=Program.cs
   var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
   var app = builder.Build();

   // Add middleware components to the pipeline
   app.Use(async (context, next) =>
   {
       // Do work before the next middleware
       await next.Invoke();
       // Do work after the next middleware
   });

   app.MapGet("/", () => "Hello World!");

   app.Run();
   ```

2. **Built-in Middleware:**
   - ASP.NET Core provides a variety of built-in middleware components for handling tasks such as authentication, authorization, static files, and more.
   - Examples of built-in middleware include `UseAuthentication`, `UseAuthorization`, `UseStaticFiles`, `UseRouting`, and `UseEndpoints`.

   ```csharp name=Program.cs
   var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
   var app = builder.Build();

   // Use built-in middleware components
   app.UseHttpsRedirection();
   app.UseStaticFiles();
   app.UseRouting();
   app.UseAuthentication();
   app.UseAuthorization();

   app.MapGet("/", () => "Hello World!");

   app.Run();
   ```

3. **Custom Middleware:**
   - You can create custom middleware to handle specific tasks that are not covered by built-in middleware.
   - Custom middleware is implemented as a class with an `Invoke` or `InvokeAsync` method that takes `HttpContext` as a parameter.
   - The custom middleware class is then added to the pipeline using the `UseMiddleware<T>` extension method.

   ```csharp name=Program.cs
   var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
   var app = builder.Build();

   // Add custom middleware to the pipeline
   app.UseMiddleware<RequestLoggingMiddleware>();

   app.MapGet("/", () => "Hello World!");

   app.Run();

   // Custom middleware class
   public class RequestLoggingMiddleware
   {
       private readonly RequestDelegate _next;
       private readonly ILogger<RequestLoggingMiddleware> _logger;

       public RequestLoggingMiddleware(RequestDelegate next, ILogger<RequestLoggingMiddleware> logger)
       {
           _next = next;
           _logger = logger;
       }

       public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
       {
           _logger.LogInformation("Handling request: {Path}", context.Request.Path);
           await _next(context);
           _logger.LogInformation("Finished handling request.");
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Middleware Pipeline:**
   - The middleware pipeline is constructed in the `Program.cs` file, and each middleware component can decide whether to call the next component in the pipeline.
   - If a middleware component does not call the next component, it short-circuits the pipeline, and no further middleware is executed.
   - This behavior is useful for handling errors or terminating requests early based on specific conditions.

   ```csharp name=Program.cs
   var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
   var app = builder.Build();

   app.Use(async (context, next) =>
   {
       // Short-circuit the pipeline for specific conditions
       if (context.Request.Path == "/terminate")
       {
           context.Response.StatusCode = StatusCodes.Status400BadRequest;
           await context.Response.WriteAsync("Request terminated");
           return;
       }

       await next.Invoke();
   });

   app.MapGet("/", () => "Hello World!");

   app.Run();
   ```

5. **Exception Handling:**
   - Middleware can be used to handle exceptions and provide custom error responses.
   - The `UseExceptionHandler` middleware provides a centralized location to handle exceptions that occur in the application.
   - Custom exception handling middleware can also be implemented to log errors or return specific error responses.

   ```csharp name=Program.cs
   var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
   var app = builder.Build();

   // Use built-in exception handling middleware
   app.UseExceptionHandler("/error");

   app.MapGet("/", () =>
   {
       throw new Exception("Test exception");
   });

   app.MapGet("/error", () => "An error occurred");

   app.Run();
   ```

### Summary:

- **Middleware Order:** The order of middleware components in the pipeline determines their execution order and is crucial for request and response processing.
- **Built-in Middleware:** ASP.NET Core provides built-in middleware for common tasks like authentication, authorization, static files, and routing.
- **Custom Middleware:** Custom middleware can be created to handle specific tasks, and it is added to the pipeline using the `UseMiddleware<T>` extension method.
- **Middleware Pipeline:** The middleware pipeline is constructed in the `Program.cs` file, and middleware components can short-circuit the pipeline to handle requests and responses early.
- **Exception Handling:** Middleware can handle exceptions and provide custom error responses, with built-in middleware like `UseExceptionHandler` and custom exception handling middleware.
