Sure! Let's delve into the two subpoints of the article "Include OpenAPI metadata in an ASP.NET Core app" on Microsoft Docs for ASP.NET Core:

### 1. Include OpenAPI Metadata for Endpoints

#### Overview:
Including OpenAPI metadata for endpoints in an ASP.NET Core app involves adding descriptive information to your API endpoints. This metadata is used to generate detailed OpenAPI (Swagger) documentation that describes the purpose, parameters, responses, and other aspects of each endpoint.

#### Key Points:
- **Annotations:** Use attributes and annotations to add metadata to your endpoints. These annotations can describe the endpoint's purpose, parameters, and responses.
- **SwaggerGen Annotations:** The `SwaggerGen` package supports various annotations to enhance the OpenAPI documentation.
- **Endpoint Descriptions:** Provide descriptions for endpoints, parameters, and responses to make the API documentation more informative and user-friendly.

#### Example:
```csharp name=Program.cs
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Add services to the container.
builder.Services.AddEndpointsApiExplorer();
builder.Services.AddSwaggerGen();

var app = builder.Build();

// Configure the HTTP request pipeline.
app.UseSwagger();
app.UseSwaggerUI();

app.MapGet("/weather", (HttpContext httpContext) =>
{
    return Results.Ok(new WeatherForecast[]
    {
        new WeatherForecast { Date = DateTime.Now, TemperatureC = 25, Summary = "Warm" }
    });
})
.WithName("GetWeather")
.WithTags("Weather")
.WithDescription("Gets the current weather forecast.")
.Produces<WeatherForecast[]>(StatusCodes.Status200OK)
.Produces(StatusCodes.Status500InternalServerError);

app.Run();

public record WeatherForecast
{
    public DateTime Date { get; set; }
    public int TemperatureC { get; set; }
    public string Summary { get; set; }
}
```

In this example:
- The `WithName`, `WithTags`, and `WithDescription` methods are used to add metadata to the `/weather` endpoint.
- The `Produces` method specifies the possible responses for the endpoint, including the status codes and response types.

### 2. Include OpenAPI Metadata for Data Types

#### Overview:
Including OpenAPI metadata for data types involves adding descriptive information to the models used in your API. This metadata helps generate detailed OpenAPI documentation that describes the structure and properties of the data types.

#### Key Points:
- **Data Annotations:** Use data annotations to add metadata to your data types. These annotations can describe the properties, their data types, and any validation rules.
- **XML Comments:** Use XML comments in your code to provide descriptions for the data types and their properties. These comments can be included in the OpenAPI documentation.
- **SwaggerGen Annotations:** The `SwaggerGen` package supports various annotations to enhance the documentation of data types.

#### Example:
```csharp name=Program.cs
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Add services to the container.
builder.Services.AddEndpointsApiExplorer();
builder.Services.AddSwaggerGen(c =>
{
    var filePath = Path.Combine(System.AppContext.BaseDirectory, "MyApi.xml");
    c.IncludeXmlComments(filePath);
});

var app = builder.Build();

app.UseSwagger();
app.UseSwaggerUI();

app.MapGet("/weather", (HttpContext httpContext) =>
{
    return Results.Ok(new WeatherForecast[]
    {
        new WeatherForecast { Date = DateTime.Now, TemperatureC = 25, Summary = "Warm" }
    });
})
.WithName("GetWeather")
.WithTags("Weather")
.WithDescription("Gets the current weather forecast.")
.Produces<WeatherForecast[]>(StatusCodes.Status200OK)
.Produces(StatusCodes.Status500InternalServerError);

app.Run();

/// <summary>
/// Represents a weather forecast.
/// </summary>
public record WeatherForecast
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Gets or sets the date of the forecast.
    /// </summary>
    public DateTime Date { get; set; }

    /// <summary>
    /// Gets or sets the temperature in Celsius.
    /// </summary>
    public int TemperatureC { get; set; }

    /// <summary>
    /// Gets or sets a summary of the weather.
    /// </summary>
    public string Summary { get; set; }
}
```

In this example:
- XML comments are added to the `WeatherForecast` record and its properties to provide descriptions.
- The `IncludeXmlComments` method is used to include the XML comments in the OpenAPI documentation.

### Summary:

- **Include OpenAPI Metadata for Endpoints:** Use attributes, annotations, and methods like `WithName`, `WithTags`, `WithDescription`, and `Produces` to add metadata to your API endpoints, making the documentation more informative.
- **Include OpenAPI Metadata for Data Types:** Use data annotations and XML comments to add metadata to your data types, providing detailed descriptions of the models and their properties in the OpenAPI documentation.
