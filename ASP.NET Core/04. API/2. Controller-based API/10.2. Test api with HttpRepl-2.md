Sure! Let's delve into the next seven subpoints of the article "Test web APIs with the HttpRepl" on Microsoft Docs for ASP.NET Core:

### 1. Test HTTP GET Requests

#### Overview:
HTTP GET requests are used to retrieve data from a web API. HttpRepl allows you to easily test GET requests and view the response.

#### Key Points:
- **GET Command:** Use the `get` command to send an HTTP GET request to the current endpoint.
- **View Response:** The response body and headers are displayed in the terminal.

#### Example:
Sending an HTTP GET request to the `/api/products` endpoint:
```bash
https://localhost:5001/api/products~: get
```

### 2. Test HTTP POST Requests

#### Overview:
HTTP POST requests are used to submit data to a web API, typically to create a new resource. HttpRepl allows you to send POST requests with a request body.

#### Key Points:
- **POST Command:** Use the `post` command to send an HTTP POST request.
- **Request Body:** Provide the request body using the `-c` (content) option or interactively.

#### Example:
Sending an HTTP POST request with a JSON body to the `/api/products` endpoint:
```bash
https://localhost:5001/api/products~: post -c "{ \"name\": \"New Product\", \"price\": 10.99 }"
```

### 3. Test HTTP PUT Requests

#### Overview:
HTTP PUT requests are used to update an existing resource on the web API. HttpRepl allows you to send PUT requests with a request body.

#### Key Points:
- **PUT Command:** Use the `put` command to send an HTTP PUT request.
- **Request Body:** Provide the request body using the `-c` (content) option or interactively.

#### Example:
Sending an HTTP PUT request with a JSON body to update a product at the `/api/products/1` endpoint:
```bash
https://localhost:5001/api/products/1~: put -c "{ \"name\": \"Updated Product\", \"price\": 12.99 }"
```

### 4. Test HTTP DELETE Requests

#### Overview:
HTTP DELETE requests are used to delete a resource from the web API. HttpRepl allows you to easily send DELETE requests to the specified endpoint.

#### Key Points:
- **DELETE Command:** Use the `delete` command to send an HTTP DELETE request.
- **No Body Required:** DELETE requests typically do not require a request body.

#### Example:
Sending an HTTP DELETE request to delete a product at the `/api/products/1` endpoint:
```bash
https://localhost:5001/api/products/1~: delete
```

### 5. Test HTTP PATCH Requests

#### Overview:
HTTP PATCH requests are used to partially update a resource on the web API. HttpRepl allows you to send PATCH requests with a request body.

#### Key Points:
- **PATCH Command:** Use the `patch` command to send an HTTP PATCH request.
- **Request Body:** Provide the request body using the `-c` (content) option or interactively.

#### Example:
Sending an HTTP PATCH request with a JSON body to update the price of a product at the `/api/products/1` endpoint:
```bash
https://localhost:5001/api/products/1~: patch -c "{ \"price\": 14.99 }"
```

### 6. Test HTTP HEAD Requests

#### Overview:
HTTP HEAD requests are used to retrieve the headers of a resource without the response body. HttpRepl allows you to send HEAD requests to check the headers of an endpoint.

#### Key Points:
- **HEAD Command:** Use the `head` command to send an HTTP HEAD request.
- **Headers Only:** The response will include headers only, without the body.

#### Example:
Sending an HTTP HEAD request to the `/api/products` endpoint:
```bash
https://localhost:5001/api/products~: head
```

### 7. Test HTTP OPTIONS Requests

#### Overview:
HTTP OPTIONS requests are used to describe the communication options for the target resource. HttpRepl allows you to send OPTIONS requests to retrieve information about the allowed methods and other options.

#### Key Points:
- **OPTIONS Command:** Use the `options` command to send an HTTP OPTIONS request.
- **Allowed Methods:** The response will include information about the allowed HTTP methods for the endpoint.

#### Example:
Sending an HTTP OPTIONS request to the `/api/products` endpoint:
```bash
https://localhost:5001/api/products~: options
```

### Summary:

- **Test HTTP GET Requests:** Use the `get` command to retrieve data from the web API.
- **Test HTTP POST Requests:** Use the `post` command to submit data and create new resources.
- **Test HTTP PUT Requests:** Use the `put` command to update existing resources.
- **Test HTTP DELETE Requests:** Use the `delete` command to delete resources.
- **Test HTTP PATCH Requests:** Use the `patch` command to partially update resources.
- **Test HTTP HEAD Requests:** Use the `head` command to retrieve headers without the response body.
- **Test HTTP OPTIONS Requests:** Use the `options` command to retrieve allowed methods and other options for the endpoint.
