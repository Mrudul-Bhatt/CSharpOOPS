Certainly! Let's go through the remaining subpoints of the article "JsonPatch in ASP.NET Core web API" on Microsoft Docs, focusing on the different operations supported by JSON Patch:

### 1. The Add Operation

#### Overview:
The `add` operation is used to add a new value to a specified location in the target JSON document. If the target location specifies an array index, the `add` operation inserts the value at that index.

#### Key Points:
- **Path:** Specifies where the new value should be added.
- **Value:** The new value to be added.
- **Behavior:** If the path points to an array, the value is inserted at the specified index. If the path points to an object property, the property is added.

#### Example:
Adding a new property to an object:
```json
{ "op": "add", "path": "/newProperty", "value": "newValue" }
```
Adding a new element to an array:
```json
{ "op": "add", "path": "/tags/0", "value": "newTag" }
```
In this example, the first operation adds a new property `newProperty` with the value `newValue` to the JSON object, and the second operation inserts `newTag` at the beginning of the `tags` array.

### 2. The Remove Operation

#### Overview:
The `remove` operation is used to remove a value at a specified location from the target JSON document. This operation can be applied to both objects and arrays.

#### Key Points:
- **Path:** Specifies the location of the value to be removed.
- **Behavior:** If the path points to an array index, the element at that index is removed. If the path points to an object property, the property is removed.

#### Example:
Removing a property from an object:
```json
{ "op": "remove", "path": "/obsoleteProperty" }
```
Removing an element from an array:
```json
{ "op": "remove", "path": "/tags/0" }
```
In this example, the first operation removes the `obsoleteProperty` from the JSON object, and the second operation removes the first element from the `tags` array.

### 3. The Replace Operation

#### Overview:
The `replace` operation is used to replace the value at a specified location with a new value. This operation is equivalent to a `remove` operation followed by an `add` operation at the same location.

#### Key Points:
- **Path:** Specifies the location of the value to be replaced.
- **Value:** The new value to replace the existing value.
- **Behavior:** The existing value at the specified location is replaced with the new value.

#### Example:
Replacing a property value in an object:
```json
{ "op": "replace", "path": "/name", "value": "Updated Name" }
```
Replacing an element in an array:
```json
{ "op": "replace", "path": "/tags/0", "value": "updatedTag" }
```
In this example, the first operation changes the value of the `name` property to `Updated Name`, and the second operation replaces the first element in the `tags` array with `updatedTag`.

### 4. The Move Operation

#### Overview:
The `move` operation is used to move a value from one location to another within the target JSON document. This operation removes the value from the `from` location and adds it to the `path` location.

#### Key Points:
- **From:** Specifies the location of the value to be moved.
- **Path:** Specifies the new location where the value should be moved.
- **Behavior:** The value is removed from the `from` location and added to the `path` location.

#### Example:
Moving a property within an object:
```json
{ "op": "move", "from": "/oldProperty", "path": "/newProperty" }
```
Moving an element within an array:
```json
{ "op": "move", "from": "/tags/0", "path": "/tags/1" }
```
In this example, the first operation moves the value from `oldProperty` to `newProperty`, and the second operation moves the first element in the `tags` array to the second position.

### 5. The Copy Operation

#### Overview:
The `copy` operation is used to copy a value from one location to another within the target JSON document. Unlike the `move` operation, the value at the `from` location remains unchanged.

#### Key Points:
- **From:** Specifies the location of the value to be copied.
- **Path:** Specifies the new location where the value should be copied.
- **Behavior:** The value is copied from the `from` location to the `path` location.

#### Example:
Copying a property within an object:
```json
{ "op": "copy", "from": "/existingProperty", "path": "/newProperty" }
```
Copying an element within an array:
```json
{ "op": "copy", "from": "/tags/0", "path": "/tags/1" }
```
In this example, the first operation copies the value from `existingProperty` to `newProperty`, and the second operation copies the first element in the `tags` array to the second position.

### 6. The Test Operation

#### Overview:
The `test` operation is used to verify that a value at a specified location is equal to a given value. This operation is useful for ensuring that a precondition is met before applying other operations.

#### Key Points:
- **Path:** Specifies the location of the value to be tested.
- **Value:** The value to compare against the existing value.
- **Behavior:** The operation succeeds if the value at the specified location matches the given value; otherwise, it fails.

#### Example:
Testing a property value in an object:
```json
{ "op": "test", "path": "/name", "value": "Expected Name" }
```
Testing an element in an array:
```json
{ "op": "test", "path": "/tags/0", "value": "expectedTag" }
```
In this example, the first operation verifies that the `name` property has the value `Expected Name`, and the second operation verifies that the first element in the `tags` array is `expectedTag`.

### Summary:

- **The Add Operation:** Adds a new value at a specified location in the JSON document.
- **The Remove Operation:** Removes a value from a specified location in the JSON document.
- **The Replace Operation:** Replaces the value at a specified location with a new value.
- **The Move Operation:** Moves a value from one location to another within the JSON document.
- **The Copy Operation:** Copies a value from one location to another within the JSON document.
- **The Test Operation:** Verifies that a value at a specified location matches a given value.
