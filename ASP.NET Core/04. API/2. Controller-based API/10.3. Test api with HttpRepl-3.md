Sure! Let's delve into the remaining five subpoints of the article "Test web APIs with the HttpRepl" on Microsoft Docs for ASP.NET Core:

### 1. Set HTTP Request Headers

#### Overview:
Setting HTTP request headers is essential for sending additional information with your requests, such as authorization tokens, custom headers, and content types. HttpRepl allows you to set headers for your HTTP requests.

#### Key Points:
- **Set Header Command:** Use the `set header` command to add or modify HTTP request headers.
- **Persistence:** Once set, headers persist for subsequent requests until they are cleared or modified.

#### Example:
Setting an `Authorization` header with a bearer token:
```bash
https://localhost:5001/api/products~: set header Authorization "Bearer your_token_here"
```

Setting a custom header:
```bash
https://localhost:5001/api/products~: set header X-Custom-Header "CustomValue"
```

### 2. Test Secured Endpoints

#### Overview:
Secured endpoints require authentication and authorization to access. HttpRepl allows you to test these endpoints by setting the necessary headers, such as authorization tokens.

#### Key Points:
- **Authentication Tokens:** Set `Authorization` headers to include tokens or credentials.
- **Secured Testing:** Ensure you have the correct permissions and tokens to access the secured endpoints.

#### Example:
Setting an `Authorization` header to test a secured endpoint:
```bash
https://localhost:5001/api/secure~: set header Authorization "Bearer your_token_here"
```

Sending a GET request to a secured endpoint:
```bash
https://localhost:5001/api/secure~: get
```

### 3. Toggle HTTP Request Display

#### Overview:
HttpRepl allows you to toggle the display of HTTP request details, such as the request method, URL, headers, and body. This feature helps you see the full details of the requests you are sending.

#### Key Points:
- **Toggle Command:** Use the `set showRequest` command to enable or disable the display of HTTP request details.
- **Visibility:** This feature is useful for debugging and understanding the exact requests being sent.

#### Example:
Enabling the display of HTTP request details:
```bash
https://localhost:5001/api/products~: set showRequest true
```

Disabling the display of HTTP request details:
```bash
https://localhost:5001/api/products~: set showRequest false
```

### 4. Run a Script

#### Overview:
HttpRepl allows you to run scripts containing a series of commands. This is useful for automating repetitive tasks or setting up complex testing scenarios.

#### Key Points:
- **Script File:** Create a script file with a list of HttpRepl commands.
- **Run Command:** Use the `run` command to execute the script.

#### Example:
Creating a script file (`test-script.txt`) with the following contents:
```bash name=test-script.txt
connect https://localhost:5001
set header Authorization "Bearer your_token_here"
cd api/products
get
post -c "{ \"name\": \"New Product\", \"price\": 10.99 }"
```

Running the script in HttpRepl:
```bash
https://localhost:5001~: run test-script.txt
```

### 5. Clear the Output

#### Overview:
Clearing the output in HttpRepl helps you manage the console by removing previous command outputs. This is useful for maintaining a clean workspace during testing sessions.

#### Key Points:
- **Clear Command:** Use the `clear` command to clear the console output.
- **Clean Workspace:** Helps you focus on the current commands and their outputs.

#### Example:
Clearing the console output:
```bash
https://localhost:5001/api/products~: clear
```

### Summary:

- **Set HTTP Request Headers:** Use the `set header` command to add or modify HTTP request headers for additional information.
- **Test Secured Endpoints:** Set `Authorization` headers to test endpoints requiring authentication and authorization.
- **Toggle HTTP Request Display:** Enable or disable the display of HTTP request details using the `set showRequest` command.
- **Run a Script:** Automate repetitive tasks by creating script files with HttpRepl commands and running them using the `run` command.
- **Clear the Output:** Use the `clear` command to maintain a clean workspace by removing previous command outputs.
