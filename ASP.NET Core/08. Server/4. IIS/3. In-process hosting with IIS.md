### Explanation of "In-process hosting with IIS and ASP.NET Core" in Microsoft Docs for ASP.NET Core

#### 1. Enable In-Process Hosting

To enable in-process hosting:

- **Project File Configuration**: Modify the `.csproj` file of your ASP.NET Core project to specify the `<AspNetCoreHostingModel>` property as `InProcess`:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <AspNetCoreHostingModel>InProcess</AspNetCoreHostingModel>
</PropertyGroup>
```

- **Web Config**: Ensure that the `web.config` file is configured correctly to include the `aspNetCore` section pointing to `InProcess`:

```xml
<aspNetCore processPath="dotnet" arguments=".\YourApp.dll" hostingModel="InProcess">
</aspNetCore>
```

#### 2. General Architecture

- **Integration with IIS**: In-process hosting integrates the ASP.NET Core application directly with the IIS worker process (`w3wp.exe`).
- **Performance**: Running in-process offers better performance compared to out-of-process hosting.
- **Single Process**: The application runs as a part of the IIS worker process, allowing for efficient request handling and resource management.
- **Startup Handling**: The `UseIIS` method in the `Program.cs` file ensures the application is configured to handle startup errors and other IIS-specific configurations.

#### 3. Application Configuration

- **In-Process Hosting Activation**: The `UseIIS` method in `Program.cs` activates the in-process hosting model:

```csharp
public static IWebHostBuilder CreateWebHostBuilder(string[] args) =>
    WebHost.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
        .UseStartup<Startup>()
        .UseIIS();
```

- **Services Configuration**: Configure services and middleware specific to IIS within the `ConfigureServices` and `Configure` methods in `Startup.cs`.

#### 4. Differences Between In-Process and Out-of-Process Hosting

- **Performance**: In-process hosting typically offers better performance due to lower overhead in request processing.
- **Process Management**: In-process hosting runs within the IIS worker process, while out-of-process hosting runs the application in a separate process using Kestrel.
- **Configuration**: In-process hosting requires setting the `<AspNetCoreHostingModel>` property to `InProcess`, whereas out-of-process hosting can use `OutOfProcess`.
- **Startup**: In-process hosting benefits from IIS-managed startup and shutdown, offering better integration with IIS management features.
- **Error Handling**: The in-process model handles startup errors within the IIS process, providing more streamlined error management.

### Summary

- **Enabling in-process hosting** involves setting the hosting model to `InProcess` in the project file and configuring the `web.config` file.
- **General architecture** integrates the ASP.NET Core application directly with the IIS worker process, improving performance.
- **Application configuration** requires using the `UseIIS` method in `Program.cs` and configuring services and middleware for IIS.
- **Differences** between in-process and out-of-process hosting include performance benefits, process management differences, and configuration specifics.
