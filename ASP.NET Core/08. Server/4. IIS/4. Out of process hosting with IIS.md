### Explanation of "Out-of-process hosting with IIS and ASP.NET Core" in Microsoft Docs for ASP.NET Core

#### 1. Overview

- **Out-of-process hosting**: ASP.NET Core applications run in a separate process from the IIS worker process.
- **Kestrel server**: The application uses the Kestrel server to handle HTTP requests.
- **IIS as a reverse proxy**: IIS acts as a reverse proxy, forwarding requests to the Kestrel server.

#### 2. Enabling Out-of-Process Hosting

- **Project File Configuration**: Modify the `.csproj` file to specify the `<AspNetCoreHostingModel>` property as `OutOfProcess`:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <AspNetCoreHostingModel>OutOfProcess</AspNetCoreHostingModel>
</PropertyGroup>
```

- **Web Config**: Ensure that the `web.config` file is configured correctly to include the `aspNetCore` section pointing to `OutOfProcess`:

```xml
<aspNetCore processPath="dotnet" arguments=".\YourApp.dll" hostingModel="OutOfProcess">
</aspNetCore>
```

#### 3. General Architecture

- **IIS and Kestrel**: IIS handles incoming HTTP requests and forwards them to the Kestrel server running the ASP.NET Core application.
- **Port Assignment**: The Kestrel server listens on a dynamic port, which is communicated to IIS through the environment variables set by the ASP.NET Core Module (ANCM).
- **Environment Variables**: ANCM sets environment variables such as `ASPNETCORE_PORT` and `ASPNETCORE_APPL_PATH` to configure the hosting environment.

#### 4. Application Configuration

- **Startup Class**: Configure services and middleware in the `Startup` class as usual.
- **Program Class**: Use the `CreateWebHostBuilder` method to configure the application to use Kestrel and integrate with IIS:

```csharp
public static IWebHostBuilder CreateWebHostBuilder(string[] args) =>
    WebHost.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
        .UseStartup<Startup>()
        .UseIISIntegration();
```

#### 5. Differences Between In-Process and Out-of-Process Hosting

- **Performance**: Out-of-process hosting has a slight performance overhead due to the additional network hop between IIS and Kestrel.
- **Process Management**: Out-of-process hosting runs the ASP.NET Core application in a separate process, providing better isolation and fault tolerance.
- **Configuration**: The hosting model is specified in the project file with the `<AspNetCoreHostingModel>` property.
- **Startup**: Out-of-process hosting uses Kestrel as the web server, which is configured in the `Program` class.

### Summary

- **Enabling out-of-process hosting** involves setting the hosting model to `OutOfProcess` in the project file and configuring the `web.config` file.
- **General architecture** uses IIS as a reverse proxy to forward requests to the Kestrel server running the ASP.NET Core application.
- **Application configuration** requires using the `UseIISIntegration` method in the `Program` class and configuring services and middleware in the `Startup` class.
- **Differences** between in-process and out-of-process hosting include performance, process management, configuration, and startup.
