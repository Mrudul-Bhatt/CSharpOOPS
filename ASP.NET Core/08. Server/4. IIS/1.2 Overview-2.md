Sure, let's break down the remaining points of the article "Host ASP.NET Core on Windows with IIS" along with some example code where necessary.

### 5. Deployment resources for IIS administrators
- **Deployment Methods:** Several methods exist to deploy an ASP.NET Core application to IIS, including manual deployment, Web Deploy (MSDeploy), and Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.
- **Web Deploy (MSDeploy):** Web Deploy is a powerful tool that can be used to synchronize server environments, deploy applications, and manage configurations. It allows for seamless deployment from Visual Studio or from a command line.
  - Example command to deploy using MSDeploy:
    ```bash
    msdeploy -verb:sync -source:package='C:\path\to\package.zip' -dest:auto,computerName="https://server:8172/msdeploy.axd?site=mysite",username="username",password="password",authtype="Basic"
    ```

### 6. Overlapped recycle
- **Purpose:** Overlapped recycling reduces downtime during the application pool recycle process. It allows a new worker process to be started before the existing worker process shuts down, ensuring that the application remains available to handle requests.
- **Configuration:** To enable overlapped recycle, you need to configure the application pool settings in IIS.
  - Example steps to enable overlapped recycle:
    1. Open IIS Manager.
    2. Select the application pool you want to configure.
    3. Click on "Advanced Settings" in the Actions pane.
    4. Set the "Start Mode" to "AlwaysRunning".
    5. Set the "Idle Time-out (minutes)" to 0.
    6. Set the "Regular Time Interval (minutes)" to the desired recycle interval.
    7. Ensure that "Overlapped Recycle" is set to "True".

### 7. Optional client certificates
- **Purpose:** Client certificates provide an additional layer of security by requiring clients to present a valid certificate before accessing the application.
- **Configuration:** To configure IIS to require client certificates, you need to modify the SSL settings for the site.
  - Example steps to configure optional client certificates:
    1. Open IIS Manager.
    2. Select the site you want to configure.
    3. Click on "SSL Settings" in the Features pane.
    4. Check the box for "Require SSL".
    5. Select "Accept" for client certificates.

### 8. Additional resources
- **Official Documentation:** Refer to the official [ASP.NET Core documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/iis/) for detailed guides and best practices.
- **Community Resources:** Utilize community forums, Stack Overflow, and GitHub repositories for additional support and examples.
- **Training and Tutorials:** Explore online courses, tutorials, and workshops to deepen your understanding of hosting ASP.NET Core applications on IIS.
