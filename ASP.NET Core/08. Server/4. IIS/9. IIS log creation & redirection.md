I couldn't retrieve the specific article "IIS log creation and redirection" from the Microsoft Docs for ASP.NET Core directly. However, I can provide an explanation based on general knowledge about IIS log creation and redirection in the context of ASP.NET Core.

### Explanation of "IIS log creation and redirection" in Microsoft Docs for ASP.NET Core

#### 1. Enabling IIS Logging
- **Purpose**: IIS logging is essential for monitoring and diagnosing issues in web applications.
- **Steps**:
  1. Open the **IIS Manager**.
  2. Select the site or server node in the **Connections** pane.
  3. Double-click on the **Logging** feature.
  4. Configure the log file settings, including the log file directory, format, and schedule.
  5. Click **Apply** to save the settings.

#### 2. Configuring Log File Locations
- **Purpose**: By default, IIS stores log files in the `%SystemDrive%\inetpub\logs\LogFiles` directory. However, you may want to change this location for better management.
- **Steps**:
  1. Open the **IIS Manager**.
  2. Select the site or server node in the **Connections** pane.
  3. Double-click on the **Logging** feature.
  4. In the **Directory** field, specify the new path where you want to store the log files.
  5. Click **Apply** to save the new log file location.

#### 3. Redirecting Logs to a Centralized Location
- **Purpose**: Centralizing log files from multiple servers or sites can simplify monitoring and analysis.
- **Methods**:
  - **Network Shares**: Configure a network share and set the log file directory to the network path.
  - **Log Shipping**: Use scripts or tools to periodically move log files from individual servers to a centralized location.
  - **Log Aggregation Services**: Use services like Azure Monitor, ELK stack, or Splunk to collect and aggregate logs.

#### 4. Customizing Log Format and Fields
- **Purpose**: Customize the log format to include specific fields that are relevant to your monitoring and diagnostic needs.
- **Steps**:
  1. Open the **IIS Manager**.
  2. Select the site or server node in the **Connections** pane.
  3. Double-click on the **Logging** feature.
  4. Select the desired log file format (e.g., W3C, IIS, NCSA).
  5. Click on **Select Fields** to customize the fields included in the log.
  6. Check or uncheck the fields as needed.
  7. Click **OK** and then **Apply** to save the settings.

#### 5. Analyzing IIS Logs
- **Purpose**: After collecting log files, analyzing them helps in understanding traffic patterns, diagnosing issues, and improving performance.
- **Tools**:
  - **Log Parser**: A powerful tool from Microsoft for querying and analyzing IIS logs.
  - **Azure Monitor**: Collect and analyze logs in Azure.
  - **Third-Party Tools**: Use tools like ELK stack, Splunk, or Sumo Logic for more advanced log analysis.

### Summary
- **Enabling IIS Logging**: Configure logging in IIS Manager to start collecting logs.
- **Configuring Log File Locations**: Change the default log file directory if needed for better management.
- **Redirecting Logs to a Centralized Location**: Use network shares, log shipping, or aggregation services to centralize logs.
- **Customizing Log Format and Fields**: Customize the fields included in the log files based on your needs.
- **Analyzing IIS Logs**: Use tools like Log Parser, Azure Monitor, or third-party tools to analyze and interpret the log data.
