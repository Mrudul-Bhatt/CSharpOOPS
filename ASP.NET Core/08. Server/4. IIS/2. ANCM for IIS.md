### ASP.NET Core Module (ANCM) for IIS

#### Overview
- The ASP.NET Core Module (ANCM) is a native IIS module that plugs into the IIS pipeline, allowing ASP.NET Core applications to work with IIS.
- ANCM allows ASP.NET Core apps to run inside IIS by hosting an ASP.NET Core app inside the IIS worker process (w3wp.exe).
- It forwards web requests to a backend ASP.NET Core app running the Kestrel server.
- The module supports both in-process and out-of-process hosting models.

#### Hosting Models
1. **In-Process Hosting**:
   - ASP.NET Core apps run inside the IIS worker process (w3wp.exe).
   - Provides better performance and diagnostics.
2. **Out-of-Process Hosting**:
   - ASP.NET Core apps run in a separate process, with Kestrel as the web server.
   - The module only works with Kestrel.
   - Does not function with HTTP.sys.

#### Hosting Models Details
- **In-Process Hosting**:
  - Uses IIS HTTP Server (`IISHttpServer`) instead of Kestrel.
  - Web requests are forwarded to the in-process ASP.NET Core app running on Kestrel.
- **Out-of-Process Hosting**:
  - The module forwards requests to the ASP.NET Core app running on Kestrel.
  - Kestrel listens on a dynamic port and processes the requests.

#### Supported Windows Versions
- Windows 7 or later
- Windows Server 2012 R2 or later

#### Hosting Models Characteristics
- **In-Process Hosting**:
  - Registers the `IISHttpServer`.
  - Configures the port and base path for the server.
  - Captures startup errors.
  - Does not apply the `requestTimeout` attribute to in-process hosting.
  - The app pool among apps isn't supported.
  - `CreateDefaultBuilder` calls `UseIIS` to:
    - Register the `IISHttpServer`.
    - Configure the port and base path.
    - Capture startup errors.
- **Out-of-Process Hosting**:
  - Only works with Kestrel.
  - Attempts to relaunch the process if it fails.

#### Startup Error Page
- Custom error pages are produced when the module fails to start the app.

#### Log Creation and Redirection
- Redirects stdout and stderr console output to disk if `stdoutLogEnabled` and `stdoutLogFile` attributes are set.
- Writes logs to the location specified in `stdoutLogFile`.

#### Configuration with `web.config`
- The module is configured with the `aspNetCore` section of the `system.webServer` node in the `web.config` file.
- Configures the module to handle site requests.

### Key Points
- **Environment Variables**: Can be specified for the process in the `processPath` attribute.
- **Proxy Configuration**: Uses the HTTP protocol and a pairing token for out-of-process hosting.
- **Compatibility**: Works with IIS and Kestrel servers.
- **Flexibility**: Supports both in-process and out-of-process hosting models to cater to different deployment needs.
