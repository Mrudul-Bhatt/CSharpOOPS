### Web Server Implementations in ASP.NET Core

The article "Web server implementations in ASP.NET Core" provides guidelines on the different web server options available for hosting ASP.NET Core applications. Here are the first four key points explained:

#### 1. Kestrel vs. HTTP.sys

##### Overview:
Kestrel and HTTP.sys are two web server options available for hosting ASP.NET Core applications. Each has its own advantages and use cases.

##### Key Points:
- **Kestrel Advantages:**
  - **Performance and Memory Utilization:** Kestrel provides better performance and memory utilization.
  - **Cross-Platform:** Kestrel is cross-platform and can run on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
  - **Agility:** Kestrel is developed and patched independently of the operating system.
  - **Programmatic Configuration:** Kestrel allows for programmatic port and TLS configuration.
  - **Extensibility:** Kestrel supports extensibility for protocols like Proxy Protocol v2 and alternate transports.

- **HTTP.sys Advantages:**
  - **Port Sharing:** HTTP.sys supports port sharing.
  - **Kernel Mode Windows Authentication:** HTTP.sys supports kernel mode Windows authentication, while Kestrel supports only user-mode authentication.
  - **Fast Proxying:** HTTP.sys allows for fast proxying via queue transfers.
  - **Direct File Transmission:** HTTP.sys supports direct file transmission.
  - **Response Caching:** HTTP.sys includes response caching.

#### 2. Hosting Models

##### Overview:
ASP.NET Core supports several hosting models, each with its own benefits and use cases. The choice of hosting model depends on the application's requirements and deployment environment.

##### Key Points:
- **Kestrel Self-Hosting:**
  - The Kestrel web server runs without requiring any other external web server such as IIS or HTTP.sys. This is a cross-platform option.

- **HTTP.sys Self-Hosting:**
  - HTTP.sys can be used as an alternative to Kestrel for self-hosting on Windows. It is recommended to use Kestrel unless specific features provided by HTTP.sys are required.

- **IIS In-Process Hosting:**
  - In this model, the ASP.NET Core application runs in the same process as the IIS worker process. This configuration provides improved performance over out-of-process hosting.

- **IIS Out-of-Process Hosting:**
  - ASP.NET Core applications run in a separate process from the IIS worker process. The ASP.NET Core Module handles process management, starting the application process when the first request arrives.

#### 3. Kestrel

##### Overview:
Kestrel is the default, cross-platform HTTP server implementation for ASP.NET Core. It provides the best performance and memory utilization among the available options.

##### Key Points:
- **Edge Server:**
  - Kestrel can be used by itself as an edge server processing requests directly from a network, including the Internet.

- **Reverse Proxy Server:**
  - Kestrel can be used with a reverse proxy server such as IIS, Nginx, or Apache. The reverse proxy server receives HTTP requests and forwards them to Kestrel.

````

- **Configuration:**
  - Kestrel supports both hosting configurations, with or without a reverse proxy server. Configuration guidance and information on when to use Kestrel in a reverse proxy configuration are available in the documentation.

#### 4. HTTP.sys

##### Overview:
HTTP.sys is a Windows-only HTTP server based on the HTTP.sys kernel driver and HTTP Server API. It is an alternative to Kestrel for hosting ASP.NET Core applications on Windows.

##### Key Points:
- **Use Cases:**
  - HTTP.sys can be used for applications that require features not available in Kestrel, such as port sharing, kernel mode Windows authentication, fast proxying, direct file transmission, and response caching.

- **Internal Network:**
  - HTTP.sys can also be used for applications that are only exposed to an internal network.

````

- **Configuration:**
  - Configuration guidance for HTTP.sys is available in the documentation.
