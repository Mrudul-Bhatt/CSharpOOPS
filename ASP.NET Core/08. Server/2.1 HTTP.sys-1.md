### HTTP.sys Web Server Implementation in ASP.NET Core

The article "HTTP.sys web server implementation in ASP.NET Core" provides detailed information on using HTTP.sys, a web server for ASP.NET Core applications on Windows. Here are the first four key points explained:

#### 1. When to Use HTTP.sys

##### Overview:
HTTP.sys is useful for certain deployment scenarios where specific features or robust security and scalability are required.

##### Key Points:
- **Direct Exposure to the Internet:**
  - HTTP.sys can be used to expose the server directly to the Internet without requiring IIS.

- **Internal Deployment Features:**
  - HTTP.sys can be used for internal deployments that require features not available in Kestrel, such as port sharing, kernel-mode authentication, and direct file transmission.

- **Mature Technology:**
  - HTTP.sys is a mature technology that provides robustness, security, and scalability. It protects against many types of attacks and can handle high traffic loads efficiently.

#### 2. HTTP/2 Support

##### Overview:
HTTP/2 is supported by HTTP.sys, providing performance improvements such as multiplexing and header compression.

##### Key Points:
- **Requirements:**
  - Windows Server 2016/Windows 10 or later
  - Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) connection
  - TLS 1.2 or later connection

- **Default Behavior:**
  - HTTP/2 is enabled by default. If an HTTP/2 connection is not established, the connection falls back to HTTP/1.1.

- **HttpRequest.Protocol:**
  - If an HTTP/2 connection is established, `HttpRequest.Protocol` reports `HTTP/2`.

#### 3. HTTP/3 Support

##### Overview:
HTTP/3 is supported by HTTP.sys, offering further performance improvements over HTTP/2.

##### Key Points:
- **Requirements:**
  - Windows Server 2022/Windows 11 or later
  - An `https` URL binding is used
  - The `EnableHttp3` registry key is set

- **Alt-Svc Header:**
  - HTTP/3 is discovered as an upgrade from HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2 via the `alt-svc` header. The first request will normally use HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2 before switching to HTTP/3.

```csharp
app.Use((context, next) =>
{
    context.Response.Headers.AltSvc = "h3=\":443\"";
    return next(context);
});
```

- **Notification:**
  - HTTP.sys also supports sending an AltSvc HTTP/2 protocol message to notify the client that HTTP/3 is available.

#### 4. Kernel Mode Authentication with Kerberos

##### Overview:
HTTP.sys supports kernel mode authentication with the Kerberos authentication protocol, providing secure and efficient authentication.

##### Key Points:
- **Kernel Mode Authentication:**
  - HTTP.sys delegates to kernel mode authentication with Kerberos. User mode authentication is not supported with Kerberos and HTTP.sys.
  - The machine account must be used for Kerberos authentication.

- **Response Buffering:**
  - In scenarios with high volumes of small writes and high latency, enabling kernel-mode response buffering can significantly improve performance.
  - Response buffering should be enabled for apps that perform synchronous I/O or asynchronous I/O with no more than one outstanding write at a time.

These key points provide an overview of the HTTP.sys web server implementation in ASP.NET Core, highlighting its use cases, support for HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, and kernel mode authentication with Kerberos.
