### Request Draining with ASP.NET Core Kestrel Web Server

The article "Request draining with ASP.NET Core Kestrel web server" provides detailed information on how Kestrel handles request draining. Here are the key points explained:

#### 1. Connection Reuse

- **Importance of Connection Reuse:**
  - Opening HTTP connections is time-consuming and, for HTTPS, also resource-intensive.
  - Kestrel tries to reuse connections per the HTTP/1.1 protocol to optimize performance.

- **Condition for Reuse:**
  - A request body must be fully consumed or drained for the connection to be reusable.
  - Example: If a client sends part of the POST data but receives a 301 response, the connection can't be used for a new request until the POST data is fully read.

#### 2. Draining Process

- **Definition:**
  - Draining the request body means reading and discarding the data without processing it.

- **Timeout:**
  - Draining has a timeout of five seconds, which is not configurable.
  - If all data specified by the `Content-Length` or `Transfer-Encoding` header isn't read before the timeout, the connection is closed.

#### 3. Terminating Requests

- **Immediate Termination:**
  - Sometimes, it's necessary to terminate the request immediately, either before or after writing the response.
  - This may be needed for clients with restrictive data caps or to limit the amount of uploaded data.

- **Using `Abort`:**
  - **Caveats:**
    - Creating new connections can be slow and expensive.
    - There's no guarantee that the client has read the response before the connection closes.
    - `Abort` should be reserved for severe error cases, not common errors.

  - **Guidelines:**
    - Only call `Abort` for specific problems, such as dealing with malicious clients or bugs in client code causing large or slow uploads.
    - Do not call `Abort` for common errors like HTTP 404 (Not Found).

- **Ensuring Response Completion:**
  - Calling `HttpResponse.CompleteAsync` before `Abort` ensures that the server has completed writing the response, although the client may not have read it.

#### 4. HTTP/2 Specifics

- **Protocol Differences:**
  - HTTP/2 supports aborting individual request streams without closing the connection, differing from HTTP/1.1.
  - The five-second drain timeout does not apply to HTTP/2.

#### 5. Client-Side Optimization

- **Using `Expect: 100-continue`:**
  - It's better for clients to use the `Expect: 100-continue` request header and wait for the server to respond before starting to send the request body.
  - This approach helps in scenarios where the request might be rejected, saving bandwidth and resources.

### Summary

Request draining in Kestrel is a mechanism to ensure that connections can be reused efficiently by consuming or discarding the request body data. Immediate termination of requests using `Abort` should be handled carefully and reserved for specific scenarios. HTTP/2 offers more flexibility with individual stream aborts, and client-side optimizations like `Expect: 100-continue` can further enhance performance.
