### Configure Endpoints for the ASP.NET Core Kestrel Web Server

The article "Configure endpoints for the ASP.NET Core Kestrel web server" provides detailed information on configuring endpoints for Kestrel, the cross-platform web server for ASP.NET Core. Here are the first four key points explained:

#### 1. Default Endpoint

##### Overview:
By default, new ASP.NET Core projects are configured to bind to specific HTTP and HTTPS ports. If no endpoint configuration is provided, Kestrel binds to a default HTTP endpoint.

##### Key Points:
- **Default Ports:**
  - New ASP.NET Core projects are configured to bind to a random HTTP port between 5000-5300 and a random HTTPS port between 7000-7300. These ports are stored in the generated `Properties/launchSettings.json` file.

- **Fallback Endpoint:**
  - If there's no endpoint configuration, Kestrel binds to `http://localhost:5000`.

#### 2. Configure Endpoints

##### Overview:
Kestrel endpoints listen for incoming connections. When an endpoint is created, it must be configured with the address it will listen to, usually a TCP address and port number.

##### Key Points:
- **Configuration Options:**
  - Endpoints can be configured using various methods, including:
    - URLs
    - Ports only
    - `appsettings.json`
    - Code

##### Configure Endpoints with URLs

- **Environment Variable:**
  - `ASPNETCORE_URLS` environment variable can be used to configure endpoints.

- **Command-Line Argument:**
  - `--urls` command-line argument can specify URLs.

- **Host Configuration Key:**
  - `urls` host configuration key allows setting URLs.

- **UseUrls Method:**
  - Use the `UseUrls` extension method to configure URLs.

- **Urls Property:**
  - The `Urls` property on `WebApplication` can be set to configure URLs.

##### URL Formats

- **IPv4 Address:**
  - Example: `http://65.55.39.10:80/`
  - `0.0.0.0` binds to all IPv4 addresses.

- **IPv6 Address:**
  - Example: `http://[0:0:0:0:0:ffff:4137:270a]:80/`
  - `[::]` binds to all IPv6 addresses.

- **Wildcard Host:**
  - Example: `http://contoso.com:80/` or `http://*:80/`
  - Used to bind to all IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

- **Loopback Address:**
  - Example: `http://localhost:5000/` or `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`
  - Binds to both IPv4 and IPv6 loopback interfaces.

- **Multiple URL Prefixes:**
  - Example: `http://*:5000;http://localhost:5001;https://hostname:5002`

#### 3. Configure HTTPS

##### Overview:
Kestrel supports securing endpoints with HTTPS. Data sent over HTTPS is encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS) to increase the security of data transmission.

##### Key Points:
- **TLS Certificate:**
  - HTTPS requires a TLS certificate, which is stored on the server and configured for Kestrel to use.

- **Configuration Options:**
  - HTTPS can be configured using:
    - URL prefixes with a default certificate
    - `appsettings.json`
    - Code

##### Configure HTTPS in appsettings.json

- **Default HTTPS Configuration Schema:**
  - Allows configuring multiple endpoints, including URLs and certificates, either from a file on disk or from a certificate store.

- **Example Configuration:**

```json name=appsettings.json
{
  "Kestrel": {
    "Endpoints": {
      "Http": {
        "Url": "http://localhost:5000"
      },
      "HttpsInlineCertFile": {
        "Url": "https://localhost:5001",
        "Certificate": {
          "Path": "<path to .pfx file>",
          "Password": "$CREDENTIAL_PLACEHOLDER$"
        }
      },
      "HttpsInlineCertAndKeyFile": {
        "Url": "https://localhost:5002",
        "Certificate": {
          "Path": "<path to .pem/.crt file>",
          "KeyPath": "<path to .key file>",
          "Password": "$CREDENTIAL_PLACEHOLDER$"
        }
      },
      "HttpsInlineCertStore": {
        "Url": "https://localhost:5003",
        "Certificate": {
          "Subject": "<subject; required>",
          "Store": "<certificate store; required>",
          "Location": "<location; defaults to CurrentUser>",
          "AllowInvalid": "<true or false; defaults to false>"
        }
      },
      "HttpsDefaultCert": {
        "Url": "https://localhost:5004"
      }
    },
    "Certificates": {
      "Default": {
        "Path": "<path to .pfx file>",
        "Password": "$CREDENTIAL_PLACEHOLDER$"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- **Schema Notes:**
  - Endpoint names are case-insensitive.
  - `Url` parameter is required for each endpoint.
  - Endpoints replace those defined in the top-level `Urls` configuration.
  - The `Certificate` section is optional and falls back to defaults or the development certificate if not specified.

These key points provide an overview of the initial topics in configuring endpoints for the Kestrel web server in ASP.NET Core, highlighting the default endpoint configuration, various methods to configure endpoints, and how to configure HTTPS.
