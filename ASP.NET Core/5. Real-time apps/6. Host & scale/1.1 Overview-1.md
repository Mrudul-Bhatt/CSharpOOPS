### Step 1: Read the Article Content

I have reviewed the article "ASP.NET Core SignalR hosting and scaling" on Microsoft Docs for ASP.NET Core. Below is a summary of the first four points mentioned in the article.

### Step 2: Summarize the Content in Subpoints

#### 1. Sticky Sessions

##### Overview:
Sticky sessions, also known as session affinity, are used to ensure that a client's requests are always handled by the same server. This is important for SignalR because it maintains a persistent connection between the client and server.

##### Key Points:
- **Session Affinity:** Ensures that all requests from a client are routed to the same server.
- **Load Balancer Configuration:** Configure the load balancer to enable sticky sessions.
- **Impact on Scaling:** Sticky sessions can limit the scalability of an application because they require a consistent routing mechanism.

##### Example:

To configure sticky sessions in an Azure App Service:

1. Go to the Azure portal.
2. Navigate to your App Service.
3. Under "Settings," select "Configuration."
4. Under "General settings," set "ARR affinity" to "On."

In this example:
- The Azure App Service is configured to use sticky sessions, ensuring that client requests are consistently routed to the same server.

#### 2. TCP Connection Resources

##### Overview:
SignalR relies on TCP connections to maintain persistent connections between clients and servers. Managing TCP connection resources efficiently is crucial for the performance and scalability of a SignalR application.

##### Key Points:
- **Connection Limits:** Be aware of the connection limits imposed by the hosting environment.
- **Resource Usage:** TCP connections consume server resources, such as CPU and memory.
- **Optimization:** Optimize the use of TCP connections to ensure efficient resource utilization.

##### Example:

To monitor and manage TCP connection resources in an ASP.NET Core application:

1. Use performance counters to monitor the number of active connections.
2. Implement connection throttling to limit the number of concurrent connections.
3. Optimize server configuration to handle high connection loads.

In this example:
- Performance counters and connection throttling are used to manage TCP connection resources efficiently.

#### 3. Scale Out

##### Overview:
Scaling out a SignalR application involves distributing connections across multiple servers to handle increased load. This can be achieved using a scale-out provider, such as Redis, Azure SignalR Service, or SQL Server.

##### Key Points:
- **Scale-Out Providers:** Use providers like Redis, Azure SignalR Service, or SQL Server to distribute connections.
- **Configuration:** Configure the SignalR application to use the chosen scale-out provider.
- **Synchronization:** Ensure that messages are synchronized across all servers in the scale-out environment.

##### Example:

To configure a SignalR application to use Redis as a scale-out provider:

```csharp name=Startup.cs
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;

public class Startup
{
    public IConfiguration Configuration { get; }

    public Startup(IConfiguration configuration)
    {
        Configuration = configuration;
    }

    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        services.AddSignalR()
            .AddRedis(options =>
            {
                options.Configuration = Configuration.GetConnectionString("RedisConnection");
            });
        services.AddControllers();
    }

    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
    {
        app.UseRouting();
        app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
        {
            endpoints.MapControllers();
            endpoints.MapHub<ChatHub>("/chathub");
        });
    }
}
```

In this example:
- The SignalR application is configured to use Redis as a scale-out provider, ensuring that connections are distributed across multiple servers.

#### 4. Azure SignalR Service

##### Overview:
Azure SignalR Service is a fully managed service that simplifies the process of scaling SignalR applications. It offloads the responsibility of managing and scaling SignalR connections to Azure.

##### Key Points:
- **Managed Service:** Azure SignalR Service handles connection management, scaling, and load balancing.
- **Integration:** Easily integrate with existing ASP.NET Core SignalR applications.
- **Scalability:** Automatically scales to handle a large number of connections.

##### Example:

To configure an ASP.NET Core SignalR application to use Azure SignalR Service:

1. Install the Azure SignalR Service SDK:

```bash
dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.SignalR
```

2. Update the `Startup` class to use Azure SignalR Service:

```csharp name=Startup.cs
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;

public class Startup
{
    public IConfiguration Configuration { get; }

    public Startup(IConfiguration configuration)
    {
        Configuration = configuration;
    }

    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        services.AddSignalR()
            .AddAzureSignalR(Configuration["Azure:SignalR:ConnectionString"]);
        services.AddControllers();
    }

    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
    {
        app.UseRouting();
        app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
        {
            endpoints.MapControllers();
            endpoints.MapHub<ChatHub>("/chathub");
        });
    }
}
```

In this example:
- The SignalR application is configured to use Azure SignalR Service by specifying the connection string in the configuration.

### Summary:

- **Sticky Sessions:** Ensure that client requests are consistently routed to the same server using session affinity.
- **TCP Connection Resources:** Manage TCP connection resources efficiently to ensure optimal performance and scalability.
- **Scale Out:** Distribute connections across multiple servers using scale-out providers like Redis, Azure SignalR Service, or SQL Server.
- **Azure SignalR Service:** Use Azure SignalR Service to manage and scale SignalR connections automatically.
