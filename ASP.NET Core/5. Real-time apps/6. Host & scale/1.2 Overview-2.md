Sure! Let's delve into the remaining points of the article "ASP.NET Core SignalR hosting and scaling" on Microsoft Docs for ASP.NET Core:

### 5. Redis Backplane

#### Overview:
A Redis backplane is used to scale out SignalR applications by distributing messages across multiple servers. It acts as a message broker, enabling different instances of a SignalR application to communicate with each other.

#### Key Points:
- **Distributed Messaging:** Redis is used to distribute messages to all connected clients across multiple servers.
- **Configuration:** SignalR can be configured to use Redis as a backplane.
- **Performance:** Redis offers high performance and low latency, making it suitable for real-time applications.

#### Example:

To configure a SignalR application to use Redis as a backplane:

```csharp name=Startup.cs
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;

public class Startup
{
    public IConfiguration Configuration { get; }

    public Startup(IConfiguration configuration)
    {
        Configuration = configuration;
    }

    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        services.AddSignalR()
            .AddRedis(options =>
            {
                options.Configuration = Configuration.GetConnectionString("RedisConnection");
            });
        services.AddControllers();
    }

    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
    {
        app.UseRouting();
        app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
        {
            endpoints.MapControllers();
            endpoints.MapHub<ChatHub>("/chathub");
        });
    }
}
```

In this example:
- The SignalR application is configured to use Redis as a backplane by specifying the Redis connection string in the configuration.

### 6. IIS Limitations on Windows Client OS

#### Overview:
When hosting SignalR applications on IIS on a Windows client operating system, there are certain limitations to be aware of. These limitations can affect the scalability and performance of the application.

#### Key Points:
- **Connection Limits:** Windows client OS has a limit on the number of concurrent connections.
- **Concurrent Requests:** IIS on Windows client OS limits the number of concurrent requests.
- **Alternative Hosting:** For production scenarios, consider using Windows Server or other hosting environments that do not impose these limitations.

#### Example:

To mitigate IIS limitations on Windows client OS:
1. Use Windows Server for hosting SignalR applications in production.
2. Optimize the application to reduce the number of concurrent connections and requests.
3. Consider using other hosting environments like Linux with Nginx.

### 7. Linux with Nginx

#### Overview:
Nginx is a popular web server that can be used to host SignalR applications on Linux. It provides high performance and can handle a large number of concurrent connections.

#### Key Points:
- **Reverse Proxy:** Nginx can act as a reverse proxy for SignalR applications.
- **Configuration:** Configure Nginx to forward requests to the SignalR application.
- **Performance:** Nginx offers high performance and scalability for hosting SignalR applications.

#### Example:

To configure Nginx as a reverse proxy for a SignalR application:

```nginx name=nginx.conf
server {
    listen 80;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:5000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
    }
}
```

In this example:
- Nginx is configured to forward requests to the SignalR application running on `http://localhost:5000`.
- The `proxy_set_header` directives ensure that WebSocket connections are handled correctly.

### 8. Third-party SignalR Backplane Providers

#### Overview:
In addition to Redis, there are other third-party backplane providers that can be used to scale out SignalR applications. These providers offer different features and performance characteristics.

#### Key Points:
- **Alternative Providers:** Consider using third-party backplane providers like Azure Service Bus, RabbitMQ, or others.
- **Integration:** Integrate the chosen backplane provider with your SignalR application.
- **Scalability:** Choose a provider that meets the scalability and performance requirements of your application.

#### Example:

To configure a SignalR application to use a third-party backplane provider, refer to the provider's documentation for specific configuration details. For example, to use Azure Service Bus as a backplane:

1. Install the necessary NuGet package:

```bash
dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.SignalR
```

2. Update the `Startup` class to use Azure Service Bus:

```csharp name=Startup.cs
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;

public class Startup
{
    public IConfiguration Configuration { get; }

    public Startup(IConfiguration configuration)
    {
        Configuration = configuration;
    }

    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        services.AddSignalR()
            .AddAzureSignalR(Configuration["Azure:SignalR:ConnectionString"]);
        services.AddControllers();
    }

    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
    {
        app.UseRouting();
        app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
        {
            endpoints.MapControllers();
            endpoints.MapHub<ChatHub>("/chathub");
        });
    }
}
```

In this example:
- The SignalR application is configured to use Azure Service Bus as a backplane by specifying the connection string in the configuration.

### Summary:

- **Redis Backplane:** Use Redis as a backplane to distribute messages across multiple servers in a SignalR application.
- **IIS Limitations on Windows Client OS:** Be aware of connection and request limits when hosting SignalR applications on IIS on Windows client OS.
- **Linux with Nginx:** Use Nginx as a reverse proxy to host SignalR applications on Linux for high performance and scalability.
- **Third-party SignalR Backplane Providers:** Consider using alternative backplane providers like Azure Service Bus or RabbitMQ for scaling out SignalR applications.
