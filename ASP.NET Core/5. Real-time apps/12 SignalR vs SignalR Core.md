I wasn't able to retrieve the file directly. However, I can summarize the key points based on my training data. Let's break down the differences between ASP.NET SignalR and ASP.NET Core SignalR as mentioned in the article "Differences between ASP.NET SignalR and ASP.NET Core SignalR" on Microsoft Docs.

### 1. How to Identify the SignalR Version

#### Overview:
Understanding the version of SignalR being used in a project is essential for proper implementation and troubleshooting.

#### Key Points:
- **Namespace:** 
  - ASP.NET SignalR uses the `Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR` namespace.
  - ASP.NET Core SignalR uses the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR` namespace.
- **Package Name:**
  - ASP.NET SignalR is available as the `Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR` NuGet package.
  - ASP.NET Core SignalR is available as the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR` NuGet package.
- **Startup Class:**
  - ASP.NET Core SignalR configuration is done in the `Startup` class using dependency injection.

### 2. Feature Differences

#### Overview:
There are several feature differences between ASP.NET SignalR and ASP.NET Core SignalR due to changes in the framework and improvements made in ASP.NET Core.

#### Key Points:
- **Protocols:**
  - ASP.NET SignalR supports JSON, and binary protocols (MessagePack).
  - ASP.NET Core SignalR supports JSON and MessagePack by default.
- **Automatic Reconnect:**
  - ASP.NET SignalR supports automatic reconnects.
  - ASP.NET Core SignalR requires manual implementation of automatic reconnects.
- **Streaming:**
  - ASP.NET Core SignalR supports server-to-client and client-to-server streaming.

### 3. Differences on the Server

#### Overview:
Several server-side differences exist between ASP.NET SignalR and ASP.NET Core SignalR, reflecting changes in the underlying frameworks.

#### Key Points:
- **Hosting:**
  - ASP.NET SignalR is hosted on IIS or self-hosted using OWIN.
  - ASP.NET Core SignalR is hosted on Kestrel and can be self-hosted or hosted on IIS.
- **Dependency Injection:**
  - ASP.NET Core SignalR fully integrates with the dependency injection system of ASP.NET Core.
- **Hub Lifetime Management:**
  - ASP.NET Core SignalR provides better control over hub lifetime events (e.g., OnConnectedAsync, OnDisconnectedAsync).

### 4. Differences on the Client

#### Overview:
Client-side implementations for ASP.NET SignalR and ASP.NET Core SignalR have notable differences, especially in terms of supported platforms and APIs.

#### Key Points:
- **Client Libraries:**
  - ASP.NET SignalR uses the `jquery.signalR.js` library for JavaScript clients.
  - ASP.NET Core SignalR uses the `@microsoft/signalr` npm package for JavaScript clients.
- **TypeScript Support:**
  - ASP.NET Core SignalR has built-in TypeScript support.
- **API Changes:**
  - Methods and properties have different names or parameters. For instance, `connection.start().done()` in ASP.NET SignalR is now `connection.start().then()` in ASP.NET Core SignalR.

### 5. Scaleout Differences

#### Overview:
Scaling out SignalR applications requires different configurations and support depending on the version used.

#### Key Points:
- **Backplane Support:**
  - ASP.NET SignalR supports SQL Server, Redis, and Azure Service Bus as backplanes.
  - ASP.NET Core SignalR supports Redis and Azure SignalR Service for scaling out.
- **Configuration:**
  - Configuration for scaling out has changed, with ASP.NET Core SignalR providing more streamlined and efficient options.

### Summary:

- **How to Identify the SignalR Version:** Look at the namespace and package names.
- **Feature Differences:** ASP.NET Core SignalR includes improvements like streaming and requires manual reconnect implementations.
- **Differences on the Server:** ASP.NET Core SignalR integrates with ASP.NET Core's dependency injection and hosting.
- **Differences on the Client:** ASP.NET Core SignalR uses different client libraries and offers TypeScript support.
- **Scaleout Differences:** ASP.NET Core SignalR supports Redis and Azure SignalR Service for scaling out.
