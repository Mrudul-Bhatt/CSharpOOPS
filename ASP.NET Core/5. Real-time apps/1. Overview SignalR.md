Sure! Let's delve into the key points of the article "Overview of ASP.NET Core SignalR" on Microsoft Docs for ASP.NET Core:

### 1. What is SignalR?

#### Overview:
ASP.NET Core SignalR is a library for adding real-time web functionality to applications. It enables server-side code to push content to clients instantly as it becomes available, rather than having the server wait for a client to request new data.

#### Key Points:
- **Real-Time Communication:** SignalR facilitates real-time communication between server and client, allowing for instant updates.
- **Client Libraries:** It provides client libraries for JavaScript, .NET, and other platforms to enable communication from various client types.
- **Automatic Reconnection:** SignalR automatically handles connection management and reconnection if the connection is lost.
- **Scalability:** SignalR supports scaling out using Redis, SQL Server, or Azure SignalR Service to handle a large number of connections.

#### Example Use Cases:
- Live chat applications
- Real-time dashboards and monitoring
- Collaborative applications (e.g., editing documents in real-time)
- Live notifications and alerts

### 2. Transports

#### Overview:
SignalR supports multiple transports for communication between the server and client. These transports provide flexibility in how data is transmitted based on the client's capabilities and network conditions.

#### Key Points:
- **WebSockets:** The preferred transport for SignalR. It offers the best performance and is supported by most modern browsers.
- **Server-Sent Events (SSE):** A one-way transport from server to client. Used when WebSockets are not available and supported by most browsers.
- **Long Polling:** A fallback transport used when neither WebSockets nor SSE are available. It involves the client repeatedly making requests to the server, leading to higher latency compared to WebSockets and SSE.

#### Transport Selection:
SignalR automatically selects the best available transport based on the client's capabilities and server configuration. Developers can also configure SignalR to use specific transports if needed.

### 3. Hubs

#### Overview:
Hubs are the central abstraction in SignalR that enable communication between clients and servers. They allow for calling methods on the server from the client and vice versa.

#### Key Points:
- **Hub Class:** Create a hub by inheriting from the `Hub` class. Methods in the hub class can be invoked by clients.
- **Client Methods:** Define client methods that can be called from the server using the `Clients` property.
- **Strongly-Typed Hubs:** Use interfaces to define strongly-typed hubs, ensuring compile-time checking of method calls.
- **Hub Context:** Use `IHubContext` to communicate with clients from outside the hub class, such as in background services.

#### Example:
```csharp name=ChatHub.cs
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class ChatHub : Hub
{
    public async Task SendMessage(string user, string message)
    {
        await Clients.All.SendAsync("ReceiveMessage", user, message);
    }
}
```

In this example:
- The `ChatHub` class inherits from `Hub` and defines a `SendMessage` method that clients can call.
- The `SendMessage` method uses the `Clients.All.SendAsync` method to broadcast a message to all connected clients.

### 4. Browsers that Don't Support ECMAScript 6 (ES6)

#### Overview:
ECMAScript 6 (ES6) is a major update to the JavaScript language that includes new features and improvements. However, some older browsers do not support ES6, which can impact the use of SignalR.

#### Key Points:
- **Polyfills:** To support older browsers that do not support ES6, developers can use polyfills. Polyfills are scripts that provide missing functionality in older browsers.
- **Compatibility:** Ensure that the SignalR client library is compatible with the browsers you need to support. Use polyfills like Babel or core-js to provide ES6 features in older browsers.
- **Browser List:** Identify the browsers that your application needs to support and test SignalR functionality in those browsers.

#### Example:
To include polyfills for older browsers, you can use Babel:

```bash
# Install Babel and core-js
npm install --save @babel/polyfill core-js
```

```javascript name=index.js
// Include the polyfills at the entry point of your application
import '@babel/polyfill';
import 'core-js/stable';
import 'regenerator-runtime/runtime';

// Your SignalR client code
import * as signalR from '@microsoft/signalr';

const connection = new signalR.HubConnectionBuilder()
    .withUrl("/chathub")
    .build();

connection.start().catch(err => console.error(err.toString()));
```

In this example:
- Babel and core-js are installed to provide ES6 polyfills.
- The polyfills are included at the entry point of the application to ensure compatibility with older browsers.

### Summary:

- **What is SignalR?:** SignalR is a library for adding real-time web functionality to applications, enabling instant server-client communication.
- **Transports:** SignalR supports multiple transports (WebSockets, SSE, Long Polling) to ensure compatibility and performance across different client environments.
- **Hubs:** Hubs are the central abstraction in SignalR for server-client communication, allowing method calls between the server and clients.
- **Browsers that Don't Support ECMAScript 6 (ES6):** Use polyfills to support older browsers that do not support ES6, ensuring compatibility of SignalR functionality.
