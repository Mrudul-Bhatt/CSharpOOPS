### Step 1: Access Article Content

I have reviewed the article "ASP.NET Core SignalR JavaScript client" on Microsoft Docs for ASP.NET Core. Below is a summary of the first four points mentioned in the article.

### Step 2: Extract and Explain Points

#### 1. Install the SignalR Client Package

##### Overview:
To use SignalR in a JavaScript client application, you need to install the SignalR client package. This package provides the necessary APIs to connect to and interact with SignalR hubs from a JavaScript application.

##### Key Points:
- **npm Package:** The SignalR JavaScript client is available as an npm package named `@microsoft/signalr`.
- **Installation:** You can install the package using npm or by adding a reference to the CDN in your HTML file.

##### Example:

###### Using npm:
```bash
npm install @microsoft/signalr
```

###### Using CDN:
```html name=index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>SignalR JavaScript Client</title>
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/microsoft-signalr/5.0.0/signalr.min.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>SignalR JavaScript Client</h1>
    <script src="signalr-client.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example:
- The SignalR client library is included using a CDN link in the HTML file.

#### 2. Connect to a Hub

##### Overview:
After installing the SignalR client package, you can connect to a SignalR hub from your JavaScript client application. This involves creating a `HubConnection` instance and starting the connection.

##### Key Points:
- **HubConnectionBuilder:** Use the `HubConnectionBuilder` class to create and configure a `HubConnection` instance.
- **start:** Call the `start` method to establish the connection to the hub.
- **URL:** Specify the hub URL in the `HubConnectionBuilder` configuration.

##### Example:

```javascript name=signalr-client.js
const connection = new signalR.HubConnectionBuilder()
    .withUrl("/chatHub")
    .build();

connection.start()
    .then(() => console.log("Connection started"))
    .catch(err => console.error("Error while starting connection: " + err));
```

In this example:
- A `HubConnection` instance is created and configured with the hub URL.
- The `start` method is called to establish the connection.

#### 3. Call Hub Methods from the Client

##### Overview:
SignalR allows the client to call methods defined in the hub. This is useful for sending data or invoking server-side logic from the client application.

##### Key Points:
- **invoke:** Use the `invoke` method to call a hub method from the client.
- **Method Arguments:** Pass the necessary arguments to the hub method using `invoke`.
- **Promise:** The `invoke` method returns a Promise.

##### Example:

```javascript name=signalr-client.js
const connection = new signalR.HubConnectionBuilder()
    .withUrl("/chatHub")
    .build();

connection.start()
    .then(() => {
        console.log("Connection started");

        // Call the SendMessage method on the hub
        connection.invoke("SendMessage", "User1", "Hello from client!")
            .then(() => console.log("Message sent to hub"))
            .catch(err => console.error("Error while sending message to hub: " + err));
    })
    .catch(err => console.error("Error while starting connection: " + err));
```

In this example:
- The client calls the `SendMessage` method defined in the hub using `invoke` and passes the method arguments.

#### 4. Call Client Methods from the Hub

##### Overview:
SignalR allows the hub to call methods defined in the client. This is useful for sending data or invoking client-side logic from the server.

##### Key Points:
- **on:** Use the `on` method to define a client method that can be called by the hub.
- **Event Handling:** Register an event handler to handle the method invocation from the hub.
- **Method Signature:** Ensure the method signature matches the one expected by the hub.

##### Example:

```javascript name=signalr-client.js
const connection = new signalR.HubConnectionBuilder()
    .withUrl("/chatHub")
    .build();

// Define a client method that can be called by the hub
connection.on("ReceiveMessage", (user, message) => {
    console.log(`${user}: ${message}`);
});

connection.start()
    .then(() => console.log("Connection started"))
    .catch(err => console.error("Error while starting connection: " + err));
```

In this example:
- The client defines a `ReceiveMessage` method using the `on` method. This method can be called by the hub to send messages to the client.

### Summary:

- **Install the SignalR Client Package:** Install the `@microsoft/signalr` package using npm or include it via CDN in your HTML file.
- **Connect to a Hub:** Use the `HubConnectionBuilder` to create and configure a `HubConnection` instance, and call `start` to establish the connection.
- **Call Hub Methods from the Client:** Use `invoke` to call hub methods from the client and pass necessary arguments.
- **Call Client Methods from the Hub:** Use the `on` method to define client methods that can be called by the hub and register event handlers.
