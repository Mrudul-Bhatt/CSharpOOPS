### Step 1: Visit the Article URL

I have reviewed the article "ASP.NET Core SignalR .NET Client" on Microsoft Docs for ASP.NET Core. Below is a summary of the first three points mentioned in the article.

### Step 2: Parse Out Subsections

#### 1. Install the SignalR .NET Client Package

##### Overview:
To use SignalR in a .NET client application, you need to install the SignalR .NET client package. This package provides the necessary APIs to connect to and interact with SignalR hubs from a .NET application.

##### Key Points:
- **NuGet Package:** The SignalR .NET client package is available as a NuGet package named `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Client`.
- **Installation:** You can install the package using the NuGet Package Manager, .NET CLI, or by adding it directly to your project file.

##### Example:

###### Using .NET CLI:
```bash
dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Client
```

###### Using Package Manager Console:
```powershell
Install-Package Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Client
```

###### Adding to Project File:
```xml name=YourProject.csproj
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net5.0</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Client" Version="5.0.0" />
  </ItemGroup>

</Project>
```

#### 2. Connect to a Hub

##### Overview:
After installing the SignalR .NET client package, you can connect to a SignalR hub from your .NET client application. This involves creating a `HubConnection` instance and starting the connection.

##### Key Points:
- **HubConnectionBuilder:** Use the `HubConnectionBuilder` class to create and configure a `HubConnection` instance.
- **StartAsync:** Call the `StartAsync` method to establish the connection to the hub.
- **URL:** Specify the hub URL in the `HubConnectionBuilder` configuration.

##### Example:

```csharp name=Program.cs
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Client;
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

class Program
{
    static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        var connection = new HubConnectionBuilder()
            .WithUrl("https://your-signalr-server/hub")
            .Build();

        connection.On<string, string>("ReceiveMessage", (user, message) =>
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"{user}: {message}");
        });

        try
        {
            await connection.StartAsync();
            Console.WriteLine("Connection started.");
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Error connecting to hub: {ex.Message}");
        }

        Console.ReadLine();
    }
}
```

In this example:
- A `HubConnection` instance is created and configured with the hub URL.
- The `StartAsync` method is called to establish the connection.
- An event handler is registered to handle messages received from the hub.

#### 3. Handle Lost Connection

##### Overview:
Handling lost connections is important to ensure that your application can recover and re-establish the connection to the SignalR hub. SignalR provides built-in mechanisms to handle reconnections.

##### Key Points:
- **Reconnecting Event:** The `Reconnecting` event is triggered when the connection is lost and SignalR starts attempting to reconnect.
- **Reconnected Event:** The `Reconnected` event is triggered when the connection is successfully re-established.
- **Closed Event:** The `Closed` event is triggered when the connection is permanently closed and will not be automatically reconnected.

##### Example:

```csharp name=Program.cs
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Client;
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

class Program
{
    static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        var connection = new HubConnectionBuilder()
            .WithUrl("https://your-signalr-server/hub")
            .Build();

        connection.On<string, string>("ReceiveMessage", (user, message) =>
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"{user}: {message}");
        });

        connection.Reconnecting += error =>
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Connection lost due to an error: {error.Message}. Reconnecting...");
            return Task.CompletedTask;
        };

        connection.Reconnected += connectionId =>
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Reconnected. ConnectionId: {connectionId}");
            return Task.CompletedTask;
        };

        connection.Closed += error =>
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Connection closed due to an error: {error?.Message}");
            return Task.CompletedTask;
        };

        try
        {
            await connection.StartAsync();
            Console.WriteLine("Connection started.");
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Error connecting to hub: {ex.Message}");
        }

        Console.ReadLine();
    }
}
```

In this example:
- The `Reconnecting` event logs a message when the connection is lost and SignalR starts reconnecting.
- The `Reconnected` event logs a message when the connection is successfully re-established.
- The `Closed` event logs a message when the connection is permanently closed.

### Summary:

- **Install the SignalR .NET Client Package:** Install the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Client` package using the .NET CLI, Package Manager Console, or by adding it to the project file.
- **Connect to a Hub:** Use the `HubConnectionBuilder` to create and configure a `HubConnection` instance, and call `StartAsync` to establish the connection.
- **Handle Lost Connection:** Handle the `Reconnecting`, `Reconnected`, and `Closed` events to manage lost connections and reconnections.
