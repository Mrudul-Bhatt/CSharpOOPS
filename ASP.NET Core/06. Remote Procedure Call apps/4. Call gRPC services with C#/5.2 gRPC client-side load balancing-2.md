### gRPC Client-Side Load Balancing

The article "gRPC client-side load balancing" on Microsoft Docs provides guidance on how to configure client-side load balancing for gRPC clients in .NET. Here are the key points explained:

#### 1. Use Load Balancing with gRPC Client Factory

##### Overview:
The gRPC client factory can be configured to use load balancing, allowing gRPC clients to distribute load across multiple servers.

##### Key Points:
- **Configuration:**
  - Configure the client with a load-balancing address and specify channel credentials.
  - Register the required types with the app's `IServiceCollection`.

- **Example Setup:**

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Services
    .AddGrpcClient<Greeter.GreeterClient>(o =>
    {
        o.Address = new Uri("dns:///my-example-host");
    })
    .ConfigureChannel(o => o.Credentials = ChannelCredentials.Insecure);

builder.Services.AddSingleton<ResolverFactory>(
    sp => new DnsResolverFactory(refreshInterval: TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30)));

var app = builder.Build();
```

#### 2. Write Custom Resolvers and Load Balancers

##### Overview:
Client-side load balancing is extensible. You can create custom resolvers and load balancers to handle specific needs.

##### Key Points:
- **Custom Resolver:**
  - Implement `Resolver` and `ResolverFactory` to create a custom resolver that resolves addresses from a new data source.
  - Example of a custom resolver:

```csharp
public class FileResolver : PollingResolver
{
    private readonly Uri _address;
    private readonly int _port;

    public FileResolver(Uri address, int defaultPort, ILoggerFactory loggerFactory)
        : base(loggerFactory)
    {
        _address = address;
        _port = defaultPort;
    }

    public override async Task ResolveAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        var jsonString = await File.ReadAllTextAsync(_address.LocalPath);
        var results = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<string[]>(jsonString);
        var addresses = results.Select(r => new BalancerAddress(r, _port)).ToArray();
        Listener(ResolverResult.ForResult(addresses));
    }
}

public class FileResolverFactory : ResolverFactory
{
    public override string Name => "file";

    public override Resolver Create(ResolverOptions options)
    {
        return new FileResolver(options.Address, options.DefaultPort, options.LoggerFactory);
    }
}
```

- **Custom Load Balancer:**
  - Implement `LoadBalancer` and `LoadBalancerFactory` to create a custom load balancer with new load balancing behavior.
  - Example of a custom load balancer:

```csharp
public class RandomBalancer : SubchannelsLoadBalancer
{
    public RandomBalancer(IChannelControlHelper controller, ILoggerFactory loggerFactory)
        : base(controller, loggerFactory)
    {
    }

    protected override SubchannelPicker CreatePicker(List<Subchannel> readySubchannels)
    {
        return new RandomPicker(readySubchannels);
    }

    private class RandomPicker : SubchannelPicker
    {
        private readonly List<Subchannel> _subchannels;

        public RandomPicker(List<Subchannel> subchannels)
        {
            _subchannels = subchannels;
        }

        public override PickResult Pick(PickContext context)
        {
            return PickResult.ForSubchannel(_subchannels[Random.Shared.Next(0, _subchannels.Count)]);
        }
    }
}

public class RandomBalancerFactory : LoadBalancerFactory
{
    public override string Name => "random";

    public override LoadBalancer Create(LoadBalancerOptions options)
    {
        return new RandomBalancer(options.Controller, options.LoggerFactory);
    }
}
```

#### 3. Configure Custom Resolvers and Load Balancers

##### Overview:
Custom resolvers and load balancers need to be registered with dependency injection (DI) when they are used.

##### Key Points:
- **Registration:**
  - Register custom resolver and load balancer implementations with `ServiceCollection`.
  - Create a channel configured to use the new implementations.

- **Example Setup:**

```csharp
var services = new ServiceCollection();
services.AddSingleton<ResolverFactory, FileResolverFactory>();
services.AddSingleton<LoadBalancerFactory, RandomBalancerFactory>();

var channel = GrpcChannel.ForAddress(
    "file:///c:/data/addresses.json",
    new GrpcChannelOptions
    {
        Credentials = ChannelCredentials.Insecure,
        ServiceConfig = new ServiceConfig { LoadBalancingConfigs = { new LoadBalancingConfig("random") } },
        ServiceProvider = services.BuildServiceProvider()
    });
var client = new Greet.GreeterClient(channel);
```

#### 4. Why Load Balancing is Important

##### Overview:
Load balancing is crucial for distributing gRPC calls across multiple servers to ensure high availability and performance.

##### Key Points:
- **HTTP/2 Multiplexing:**
  - HTTP/2 multiplexes multiple calls on a single TCP connection. Without proper load balancing, all gRPC calls could be sent to a single server, leading to potential bottlenecks.

- **Network Load Balancers:**
  - Network load balancers (NLBs) operate at the connection level and may not effectively distribute gRPC calls.
  - Application load balancers or client-side load balancing are better suited for gRPC.

- **Benefits of Client-Side Load Balancing:**
  - Direct control over load balancing decisions.
  - Eliminates the need for an additional network hop, reducing latency and resource consumption.

### Summary:

- **Use Load Balancing with gRPC Client Factory:** Configure the client factory to use load balancing by setting the address and channel credentials.
- **Write Custom Resolvers and Load Balancers:** Create custom implementations to handle specific load balancing needs.
- **Configure Custom Resolvers and Load Balancers:** Register custom implementations with DI and configure the channel to use them.
- **Why Load Balancing is Important:** Ensure high availability and performance by effectively distributing gRPC calls across multiple servers.
