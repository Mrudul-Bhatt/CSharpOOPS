### gRPC Client Factory Integration in .NET

Continuing from the previous points, here are the explanations for the remaining points:

#### 5. Call Credentials

##### Overview:
Call credentials are used to send authentication metadata, such as an authorization token, with each gRPC call. This ensures that the client is authenticated when making requests to the server.

##### Key Points:
- **Add Call Credentials:**
  - Use the `AddCallCredentials` method to add authentication metadata to gRPC calls.
  - Example:

```csharp
builder.Services
    .AddGrpcClient<Greeter.GreeterClient>(o =>
    {
        o.Address = new Uri("https://localhost:5001");
    })
    .AddCallCredentials((context, metadata) =>
    {
        if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(_token))
        {
            metadata.Add("Authorization", $"Bearer {_token}");
        }
        return Task.CompletedTask;
    });
```

- **Bearer Token:**
  - The example shows how to add a bearer token to the metadata for each gRPC call.
  - This is useful for securing gRPC services that require authentication.

#### 6. Deadline and Cancellation Propagation

##### Overview:
Setting a deadline for a gRPC call limits the amount of time the call can run. Cancellation propagation allows child calls to inherit the cancellation token and deadline from the parent call.

##### Key Points:
- **Enable Call Context Propagation:**
  - Use the `EnableCallContextPropagation` method to automatically propagate the deadline and cancellation token to child calls.
  - Example:

```csharp
builder.Services
    .AddGrpcClient<Greeter.GreeterClient>(o =>
    {
        o.Address = new Uri("https://localhost:5001");
    })
    .EnableCallContextPropagation();
```

- **Suppress Context Not Found Errors:**
  - By default, `EnableCallContextPropagation` raises an error if the client is used outside the context of a gRPC call.
  - You can suppress this error by configuring the option.
  - Example:

```csharp
builder.Services
    .AddGrpcClient<Greeter.GreeterClient>(o =>
    {
        o.Address = new Uri("https://localhost:5001");
    })
    .EnableCallContextPropagation(o => o.SuppressContextNotFoundErrors = true);
```

#### 7. Named Clients

##### Overview:
Named clients allow you to register multiple configurations for the same gRPC client type. This is useful when you need different settings or credentials for different scenarios.

##### Key Points:
- **Register Named Clients:**
  - Use the `AddGrpcClient` method with a name parameter to register named gRPC clients.
  - Example:

```csharp
builder.Services
    .AddGrpcClient<Greeter.GreeterClient>("Greeter", o =>
    {
        o.Address = new Uri("https://localhost:5001");
    });

builder.Services
    .AddGrpcClient<Greeter.GreeterClient>("GreeterAuthenticated", o =>
    {
        o.Address = new Uri("https://localhost:5001");
    })
    .ConfigureChannel(o =>
    {
        o.Credentials = new CustomCredentials();
    });
```

- **Create Named Clients:**
  - Use the `GrpcClientFactory.CreateClient` method to create named gRPC clients in your application code.
  - Example:

```csharp
public class AggregatorService : Aggregator.AggregatorBase
{
    private readonly Greeter.GreeterClient _client;

    public AggregatorService(GrpcClientFactory grpcClientFactory)
    {
        _client = grpcClientFactory.CreateClient<Greeter.GreeterClient>("GreeterAuthenticated");
    }
}
```

### Summary:

- **Call Credentials:** Add authentication metadata to gRPC calls using the `AddCallCredentials` method.
- **Deadline and Cancellation Propagation:** Use `EnableCallContextPropagation` to propagate deadlines and cancellation tokens to child calls.
- **Named Clients:** Register and configure multiple named gRPC clients for different scenarios using the `AddGrpcClient` method with a name parameter.
