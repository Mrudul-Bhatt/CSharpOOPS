### Use gRPC in Browser Apps

The article "Use gRPC in browser apps" on Microsoft Docs provides guidance on how to make ASP.NET Core gRPC services callable from browser applications. Here are the key points explained:

#### 1. gRPC-Web

##### Overview:
gRPC-Web allows browser applications to call gRPC services using the gRPC-Web client and Protobuf.

##### Key Points:
- **Compatibility:**
  - gRPC-Web is similar to normal gRPC but has a slightly different wire-protocol, making it compatible with HTTP/1.1 and browsers.

- **Client Generation:**
  - The browser application needs to generate a gRPC client from a `.proto` file.

- **Benefits:**
  - Browser applications benefit from the high performance and low network usage of binary messages.

- **Built-in Support:**
  - .NET has built-in support for gRPC-Web.
  - For more information, refer to the [gRPC-Web documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/grpc/grpcweb).

#### 2. gRPC JSON Transcoding

##### Overview:
gRPC JSON transcoding allows browser applications to call gRPC services as if they were RESTful APIs with JSON.

##### Key Points:
- **No gRPC Client Required:**
  - The browser application does not need to generate a gRPC client or know anything about gRPC.

- **Automatic RESTful APIs:**
  - RESTful APIs are automatically created from gRPC services by annotating the `.proto` file with HTTP metadata.

- **Dual Support:**
  - Allows an application to support both gRPC and JSON web APIs without duplicating the effort of building separate services for both.

- **Built-in Support:**
  - .NET has built-in support for creating JSON web APIs from gRPC services.
  - For more information, refer to the [gRPC JSON transcoding documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/grpc/json-transcoding).

- **Requirement:**
  - gRPC JSON transcoding requires .NET 7 or later.

### Summary:

- **gRPC-Web:** Allows browser applications to call gRPC services using gRPC-Web client and Protobuf, with built-in support in .NET.
- **gRPC JSON Transcoding:** Allows browser applications to call gRPC services as RESTful APIs with JSON, enabling dual support for gRPC and JSON web APIs, with built-in support in .NET (requires .NET 7 or later).
