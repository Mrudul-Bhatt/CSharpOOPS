I wasn't able to retrieve the file directly. However, I can summarize the key points based on my training data. Let's break down the article "Test gRPC services in ASP.NET Core" as mentioned on Microsoft Docs.

### Test gRPC Services in ASP.NET Core

#### 1. Example Testable Service

##### Overview:
Creating a testable gRPC service involves designing the service in a way that allows its methods to be easily tested. This generally includes using dependency injection and interfaces to abstract dependencies.

##### Key Points:
- **Design for Testability:**
  - Use dependency injection to inject dependencies into the service.
  - Abstract dependencies using interfaces to allow for mocking during tests.
  - Example service definition:

```csharp name=GreeterService.cs
using Grpc.Core;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public interface IGreeterService
{
    Task<HelloReply> SayHello(HelloRequest request);
}

public class GreeterService : Greeter.GreeterBase
{
    private readonly IGreeterService _greeterService;
    private readonly ILogger<GreeterService> _logger;

    public GreeterService(IGreeterService greeterService, ILogger<GreeterService> logger)
    {
        _greeterService = greeterService;
        _logger = logger;
    }

    public override async Task<HelloReply> SayHello(HelloRequest request, ServerCallContext context)
    {
        _logger.LogInformation("Saying hello to {Name}", request.Name);
        return await _greeterService.SayHello(request);
    }
}
```

- **Implement the Interface:**
  - Provide an implementation for the interface that contains the business logic.
  - Example implementation:

```csharp name=GreeterServiceImpl.cs
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class GreeterServiceImpl : IGreeterService
{
    public Task<HelloReply> SayHello(HelloRequest request)
    {
        return Task.FromResult(new HelloReply
        {
            Message = $"Hello {request.Name}"
        });
    }
}
```

#### 2. Unit Test gRPC Services

##### Overview:
Unit testing gRPC services involves testing the service methods in isolation from their dependencies. This is typically achieved by mocking the dependencies and verifying the service behavior.

##### Key Points:
- **Setup Unit Tests:**
  - Use a testing framework like xUnit or NUnit.
  - Use a mocking library like Moq to create mock objects for dependencies.
  - Example unit test setup with xUnit and Moq:

```csharp name=GreeterServiceTests.cs
using Grpc.Core;
using Moq;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Xunit;

public class GreeterServiceTests
{
    [Fact]
    public async Task SayHello_ReturnsExpectedMessage()
    {
        // Arrange
        var mockGreeterService = new Mock<IGreeterService>();
        mockGreeterService.Setup(service => service.SayHello(It.IsAny<HelloRequest>()))
            .ReturnsAsync(new HelloReply { Message = "Hello Test" });
        var logger = Mock.Of<ILogger<GreeterService>>();
        var service = new GreeterService(mockGreeterService.Object, logger);

        // Act
        var response = await service.SayHello(new HelloRequest { Name = "Test" }, It.IsAny<ServerCallContext>());

        // Assert
        Assert.Equal("Hello Test", response.Message);
    }
}
```

- **Verify Behavior:**
  - Verify that the service method behaves as expected and interacts correctly with its dependencies.

#### 3. Integration Test gRPC Services

##### Overview:
Integration testing gRPC services involves testing the service in a more complete environment, including the actual dependencies and infrastructure. This helps ensure that the service works correctly in a real-world scenario.

##### Key Points:
- **Setup Integration Tests:**
  - Use an in-memory gRPC server to host the service during tests.
  - Use a testing framework like xUnit or NUnit.
  - Example integration test setup with xUnit:

```csharp name=GreeterServiceIntegrationTests.cs
using Grpc.Net.Client;
using Grpc.Core;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.TestHost;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Xunit;

public class GreeterServiceIntegrationTests
{
    private readonly TestServer _server;
    private readonly GrpcChannel _channel;

    public GreeterServiceIntegrationTests()
    {
        // Arrange
        var builder = new WebHostBuilder()
            .ConfigureServices(services =>
            {
                services.AddGrpc();
                services.AddSingleton<IGreeterService, GreeterServiceImpl>();
            })
            .Configure(app =>
            {
                app.UseRouting();
                app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
                {
                    endpoints.MapGrpcService<GreeterService>();
                });
            });

        _server = new TestServer(builder);
        _channel = GrpcChannel.ForAddress("http://localhost", new GrpcChannelOptions { HttpClient = _server.CreateClient() });
    }

    [Fact]
    public async Task SayHello_ReturnsExpectedMessage()
    {
        // Act
        var client = new Greeter.GreeterClient(_channel);
        var response = await client.SayHelloAsync(new HelloRequest { Name = "Test" });

        // Assert
        Assert.Equal("Hello Test", response.Message);
    }
}
```

- **Verify End-to-End Behavior:**
  - Ensure that the service correctly handles requests and responses, and interacts with its dependencies as expected in a real-world scenario.

### Summary:

- **Example Testable Service:** Design the gRPC service with testability in mind by using dependency injection and interfaces.
- **Unit Test gRPC Services:** Test service methods in isolation using mock objects for dependencies.
- **Integration Test gRPC Services:** Test the service in a more complete environment using an in-memory gRPC server to ensure real-world functionality.
