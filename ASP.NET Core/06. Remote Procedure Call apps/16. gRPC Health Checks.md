### gRPC Health Checks in ASP.NET Core

The article "gRPC health checks in ASP.NET Core" provides guidance on using gRPC health checks to report the health of gRPC server apps. Here are the key points explained:

#### 1. Set up gRPC Health Checks

##### Overview:
gRPC ASP.NET Core has built-in support for gRPC health checks with the `Grpc.AspNetCore.HealthChecks` package. This package helps set up health checks and expose them as a gRPC service.

##### Key Points:
- **Add Package Reference:**
  - Add a `Grpc.AspNetCore.HealthChecks` package reference to your project.

```xml name=GrpcServiceHC.csproj
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net6.0</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Grpc.AspNetCore.HealthChecks" Version="1.0.0" />
  </ItemGroup>

</Project>
```

- **Register Health Checks Service:**
  - In the `Program.cs` file, register the gRPC health checks service using `AddGrpcHealthChecks` and add the health checks service endpoint using `MapGrpcHealthChecksService`.

```csharp name=Program.cs
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Services.AddGrpcHealthChecks()
    .AddCheck("example_health_check", () => HealthCheckResult.Healthy());

var app = builder.Build();

app.MapGrpcHealthChecksService();

app.Run();
```

- **Implement Health Checks:**
  - Add health checks by implementing `IHealthCheck` or using `HealthChecksBuilderAddCheckExtensions`.

```csharp name=ExampleHealthCheck.cs
using Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks;
using System.Threading;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class ExampleHealthCheck : IHealthCheck
{
    public Task<HealthCheckResult> CheckHealthAsync(HealthCheckContext context, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
    {
        // Check health logic here
        return Task.FromResult(HealthCheckResult.Healthy("The check indicates a healthy result."));
    }
}
```

- **Health Checks Execution:**
  - Health checks are executed periodically, with a 5-second delay after app startup and then every 30 seconds by default.
  - Health results determine what the gRPC service reports:
    - `Unknown` is reported when there are no health results.
    - `NotServing` is reported when there are any health results of `HealthStatus.Unhealthy`.
    - Otherwise, `Serving` is reported.

- **Security:**
  - Limit access to the gRPC health checks service using standard ASP.NET Core authorization methods, such as `AllowAnonymous`.

```csharp
app.MapGrpcHealthChecksService().AllowAnonymous();
```

#### 2. Call gRPC Health Checks Service

##### Overview:
The `Grpc.HealthCheck` package includes a client for gRPC health checks, allowing you to call the health checks service and obtain the health status.

##### Key Points:
- **Add Package Reference:**
  - Add a `Grpc.HealthCheck` package reference to your project.

```xml name=GrpcHealthCheckClient.csproj
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
    <TargetFramework>net6.0</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Grpc.HealthCheck" Version="2.40.0" />
    <PackageReference Include="Grpc.Net.Client" Version="2.40.0" />
  </ItemGroup>

</Project>
```

- **Create gRPC Client:**
  - In the client application, create a gRPC channel and a health check client to call the health checks service.

```csharp name=Program.cs
using Grpc.Health.V1;
using Grpc.Net.Client;

var channel = GrpcChannel.ForAddress("https://localhost:5001");
var client = new Health.HealthClient(channel);

var response = await client.CheckAsync(new HealthCheckRequest());
var status = response.Status;
Console.WriteLine($"Health status: {status}");
```

- **Methods on Health Service:**
  - `Check`: A unary method for getting the current health status. Health checks are executed immediately when `Check` is called. The server returns a `NOT_FOUND` error response if the client requests an unknown service.
  - `Watch`: A streaming method that reports changes in health status over time. It periodically executes `IHealthCheckPublisher` to gather health results and reports changes.

```csharp
var responseStream = client.Watch(new HealthCheckRequest());
while (await responseStream.ResponseStream.MoveNext())
{
    var status = responseStream.ResponseStream.Current.Status;
    Console.WriteLine($"Health status: {status}");
}
```

- **Client Factory Approach:**
  - Use a client factory to register and inject `Health.HealthClient` instances into services for executing health checks.

```csharp
builder.Services
    .AddGrpcClient<Health.HealthClient>(o =>
    {
        o.Address = new Uri("https://localhost:5001");
    });
```
