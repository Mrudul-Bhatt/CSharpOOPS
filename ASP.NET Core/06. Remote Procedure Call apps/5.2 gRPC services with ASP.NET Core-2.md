### gRPC Services with ASP.NET Core

The article "gRPC services with ASP.NET Core" provides guidance on how to get started with gRPC services using ASP.NET Core. Here are the explanations for the remaining points:

#### 6. IIS

##### Overview:
Internet Information Services (IIS) is a flexible, secure, and manageable web server for hosting web applications, including ASP.NET Core applications. IIS supports hosting gRPC services with certain configurations.

##### Key Points:
- **Requirements:**
  - Requires .NET 5 and Windows 11 Build 22000 or Windows Server 2022 Build 20348 or later.

- **Configuration:**
  - IIS must be configured to use TLS and HTTP/2 for hosting gRPC services.
  - TLS ensures secure communication, while HTTP/2 is required for gRPC.

- **Example Configuration:**
  - Configure IIS to use HTTP/2 and TLS by following the instructions provided in the [IIS protocols documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/iis/protocols).

#### 7. HTTP.sys

##### Overview:
HTTP.sys is a web server for ASP.NET Core that runs only on Windows. It is designed for edge deployments and can handle large volumes of HTTP requests.

##### Key Points:
- **Requirements:**
  - Requires .NET 5 and Windows 11 Build 22000 or Windows Server 2022 Build 20348 or later.

- **Configuration:**
  - HTTP.sys must be configured to use TLS and HTTP/2 for hosting gRPC services.
  - TLS ensures secure communication, while HTTP/2 is required for gRPC.

- **Example Configuration:**
  - Configure HTTP.sys to use HTTP/2 and TLS by following the instructions provided in the [HTTP.sys web server HTTP/2 support documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/servers/httpsys#http2-support).

#### 8. Host gRPC in Non-ASP.NET Core Projects

##### Overview:
You can add a gRPC server to non-ASP.NET Core projects, such as Windows Services, WPF apps, or WinForms apps, by configuring the project file appropriately.

##### Key Points:
- **Project File Configuration:**
  - The project file should not use `Microsoft.NET.SDK.Web` as the SDK.
  - Add a framework reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App`.
  - Add a NuGet package reference to `Grpc.AspNetCore`.
  - Include the `.proto` file for generating gRPC service code.

- **Example Project File:**

```xml name=Server.csproj
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net5.0</TargetFramework>
    <FrameworkReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.App" />
  </PropertyGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Grpc.AspNetCore" Version="2.45.0" />
    <Protobuf Include="Protos\greet.proto" GrpcServices="Server" />
  </ItemGroup>

</Project>
```

#### 9. Integration with ASP.NET Core APIs

##### Overview:
gRPC services have full access to ASP.NET Core features such as Dependency Injection (DI) and Logging.

##### Key Points:
- **Dependency Injection:**
  - gRPC service implementations can resolve other DI services with any lifetime (Singleton, Scoped, or Transient).

- **Logging:**
  - gRPC services can use ASP.NET Core's logging infrastructure to log information, warnings, and errors.

- **Accessing HttpContext:**
  - The gRPC API provides access to some HTTP/2 message data through the `ServerCallContext` argument passed to each gRPC method.
  - Full access to `HttpContext` is provided by the `GetHttpContext` extension method.

- **Example Service Implementation:**

```csharp name=GreeterService.cs
public class GreeterService : Greeter.GreeterBase
{
    private readonly ILogger<GreeterService> _logger;

    public GreeterService(ILogger<GreeterService> logger)
    {
        _logger = logger;
    }

    public override Task<HelloReply> SayHello(HelloRequest request, ServerCallContext context)
    {
        var httpContext = context.GetHttpContext();
        _logger.LogInformation("Handling gRPC request with method: {Method}", httpContext.Request.Method);

        return Task.FromResult(new HelloReply
        {
            Message = "Hello " + request.Name
        });
    }
}
```

### Summary:

- **IIS:** Configure IIS to use TLS and HTTP/2 for hosting gRPC services on Windows.
- **HTTP.sys:** Configure HTTP.sys to use TLS and HTTP/2 for hosting gRPC services on Windows.
- **Host gRPC in Non-ASP.NET Core Projects:** Add a gRPC server to non-ASP.NET Core projects by configuring the project file with the necessary references and packages.
- **Integration with ASP.NET Core APIs:** gRPC services can utilize ASP.NET Core features such as Dependency Injection and Logging, and can access HTTP/2 message data through `ServerCallContext`.
