### gRPC Services with ASP.NET Core

The article "gRPC services with ASP.NET Core" provides guidance on how to get started with gRPC services using ASP.NET Core. Here are the key points explained:

#### 1. Prerequisites

##### Overview:
Before you start developing gRPC services with ASP.NET Core, you need to ensure that you have the necessary tools and software installed.

##### Key Points:
- **Visual Studio:**
  - Ensure you have the latest version of Visual Studio installed with the .NET Core cross-platform development workload.
  - Install the ASP.NET and web development workload.

- **Visual Studio Code:**
  - Ensure you have the latest version of Visual Studio Code installed.
  - Install the C# extension for Visual Studio Code.
  - Install the .NET SDK.

- **Visual Studio for Mac:**
  - Ensure you have the latest version of Visual Studio for Mac installed.
  - Install the .NET Core cross-platform development workload.

#### 2. Get Started with gRPC Service in ASP.NET Core

##### Overview:
This section provides instructions on how to create a new gRPC service project using different IDEs.

##### Key Points:
- **Visual Studio:**
  - Follow the detailed instructions provided in the "Get started with gRPC services" tutorial to create a gRPC project.

- **Visual Studio Code / Visual Studio for Mac:**
  - Run the following command from the command line to create a new gRPC project:

```sh
dotnet new grpc -o GrpcGreeter
```

#### 3. Add gRPC Services to an ASP.NET Core App

##### Overview:
This section explains how to add gRPC services to an existing ASP.NET Core application.

##### Key Points:
- **Add gRPC Package:**
  - Add the `Grpc.AspNetCore` package to your project.

- **Configure gRPC:**
  - Enable gRPC in `Program.cs` using the `AddGrpc` method.
  - Add each gRPC service to the routing pipeline using the `MapGrpcService` method.

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.Services.AddGrpc();

var app = builder.Build();
app.MapGrpcService<GreeterService>();
app.Run();
```

- **Integration with ASP.NET Core Middleware:**
  - gRPC services can be integrated with other ASP.NET Core middleware and features.

#### 4. Server Options

##### Overview:
gRPC services can be hosted by all built-in ASP.NET Core servers.

##### Key Points:
- **Supported Servers:**
  - **Kestrel:** A cross-platform web server for ASP.NET Core.
  - **TestServer:** A server used for testing.
  - **IIS:** Requires .NET 5 and Windows 11 Build 22000 or Windows Server 2022 Build 20348 or later.
  - **HTTP.sys:** A web server for ASP.NET Core that runs on Windows.

- **Choosing the Right Server:**
  - Choose the appropriate server based on your application's requirements and environment.

#### 5. Kestrel

##### Overview:
Kestrel is a cross-platform web server for ASP.NET Core that focuses on high performance and memory utilization.

##### Key Points:
- **HTTP/2 Support:**
  - gRPC requires HTTP/2. Kestrel supports HTTP/2 on most modern operating systems.
  - Kestrel endpoints are configured to support HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 connections by default.

- **TLS:**
  - Kestrel endpoints used for gRPC should be secured with Transport Layer Security (TLS).
  - In development, an endpoint secured with TLS is automatically created at `https://localhost:5001`.
  - In production, TLS must be explicitly configured.

- **Protocol Negotiation:**
  - The TLS Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) handshake is used to negotiate the connection protocol.
  - If an HTTP/2 endpoint is configured without TLS, the endpoint's `ListenOptions.Protocols` must be set to `HttpProtocols.Http2`.

- **Example Configuration:**

```json name=appsettings.json
{
  "Kestrel": {
    "Endpoints": {
      "HttpsDefaultCert": {
        "Url": "https://localhost:5001",
        "Protocols": "Http2"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```csharp name=Program.cs
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.WebHost.ConfigureKestrel(options =>
{
    options.Listen(IPAddress.Loopback, 5001, listenOptions =>
    {
        listenOptions.UseHttps();
        listenOptions.Protocols = HttpProtocols.Http2;
    });
});
var app = builder.Build();
app.Run();
```

### Summary:

- **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have the necessary tools and software installed for your development environment.
- **Get Started with gRPC Service:** Follow the instructions to create a new gRPC service project using Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, or Visual Studio for Mac.
- **Add gRPC Services to an ASP.NET Core App:** Add the `Grpc.AspNetCore` package, configure gRPC, and integrate it with other ASP.NET Core middleware.
- **Server Options:** gRPC services can be hosted by Kestrel, TestServer, IIS, and HTTP.sys.
- **Kestrel:** Configure Kestrel to support HTTP/2 and secure it with TLS for gRPC services.
