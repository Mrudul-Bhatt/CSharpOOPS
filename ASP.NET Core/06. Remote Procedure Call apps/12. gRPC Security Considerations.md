### Security Considerations in gRPC for ASP.NET Core

The article "Security considerations in gRPC for ASP.NET Core" provides information on securing gRPC with .NET Core. Here are the key points explained:

#### 1. Transport Security

##### Overview:
gRPC messages are sent and received using HTTP/2. To secure messages in production gRPC apps, it is recommended to use Transport Layer Security (TLS).

##### Key Points:
- **TLS Usage:**
  - TLS should be used to secure messages in production gRPC apps.
  - gRPC services should only listen and respond over secured ports.

- **TLS Configuration:**
  - TLS is configured in Kestrel. For more information on configuring Kestrel endpoints, see the relevant documentation for your version of ASP.NET Core.
    - For ASP.NET Core 5.0 and later, refer to [Kestrel endpoint configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/servers/kestrel/endpoints).
    - For versions earlier than ASP.NET Core 5.0, refer to [Kestrel endpoint configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/servers/kestrel#endpoint-configuration).

- **TLS Termination Proxy:**
  - A TLS termination proxy can be combined with TLS. The benefits of using TLS termination should be considered against the security risks of sending unencrypted messages between the proxy and gRPC service.

#### 2. Exceptions

##### Overview:
Exception messages are generally considered sensitive data that shouldn't be revealed to a client. By default, gRPC doesn't send the details of an exception thrown by a gRPC service to the client.

##### Key Points:
- **Sensitive Data:**
  - Exception messages are considered sensitive and should not be exposed to clients.
  - gRPC hides the details of exceptions by default, preventing sensitive information from being leaked.

- **Default Behavior:**
  - When an exception is thrown by a gRPC service, the client receives a generic error message without the specific details of the exception.

#### 3. Message Size Limits

##### Overview:
Incoming messages to gRPC clients and services are loaded into memory. Message size limits help prevent gRPC from consuming excessive resources.

##### Key Points:
- **Default Limits:**
  - By default, gRPC limits incoming messages to 4 MB. There is no limit on outgoing messages.

- **Server Configuration:**
  - gRPC message limits can be configured for all services in an app with `AddGrpc`.

```csharp name=Startup.cs
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddGrpc(options =>
    {
        options.MaxReceiveMessageSize = 1 * 1024 * 1024; // 1 MB
        options.MaxSendMessageSize = 1 * 1024 * 1024; // 1 MB
    });
}
```

- **Service-Specific Configuration:**
  - Limits can also be configured for an individual service using `AddServiceOptions<TService>`.

#### 4. Client Certificate Validation

##### Overview:
Client certificates are initially validated when the connection is established. By default, Kestrel doesn't perform additional validation of a client's certificate once the connection is established.

##### Key Points:
- **Initial Validation:**
  - Client certificates are validated when the connection is established, checking aspects like the certificate's validity period and revocation status.

- **Additional Validation:**
  - It is recommended that gRPC services secured by client certificates use the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Certificate` package to perform additional validation.

- **Validation Checks:**
  - The `CertificateAuthenticationOptions` provided by the package performs additional checks:
    - Certificate has a valid extended key use (EKU).
    - Certificate is within its validity period.
    - Certificate revocation status is checked.

```csharp name=Startup.cs
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddAuthentication(CertificateAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
        .AddCertificate(options =>
        {
            options.AllowedCertificateTypes = CertificateTypes.All;
            options.ValidateCertificateUse = true;
            options.RevocationMode = X509RevocationMode.Online;
        });

    services.AddGrpc();
}
```

### Summary:

- **Transport Security:** Use TLS to secure messages in production gRPC apps and configure TLS in Kestrel.
- **Exceptions:** Hide exception details from clients to prevent sensitive data exposure.
- **Message Size Limits:** Configure message size limits to prevent excessive resource consumption.
- **Client Certificate Validation:** Use the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Certificate` package to perform additional validation checks on client certificates.
