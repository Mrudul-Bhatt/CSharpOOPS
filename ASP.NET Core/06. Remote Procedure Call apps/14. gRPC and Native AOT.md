### gRPC and Native AOT

The article "gRPC and Native AOT" provides guidance on using .NET native ahead-of-time (AOT) with gRPC in .NET 8. Here are the first three key points explained:

#### 1. Get Started

##### Overview:
AOT compilation happens when the app is published. Native AOT is enabled with the `PublishAot` option.

##### Key Points:
- **Enable Native AOT:**
  - Add `<PublishAot>true</PublishAot>` to the gRPC client or server app's project file to enable Native AOT compilation during publish and dynamic code usage analysis during build and publish.

```xml name=Server.csproj
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
    <PublishAot>true</PublishAot>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.Grpc" Version="8.0.0" />
  </ItemGroup>

</Project>
```

- **Using Command Line:**
  - Native AOT can also be enabled by specifying the `-aot` option with the ASP.NET Core gRPC template.

```dotnetcli
dotnet new grpc -aot
```

- **Publish the App:**
  - Publish the app for a specific [runtime identifier (RID)](/dotnet/core/rid-catalog) using `dotnet publish -r <RID>`.

```dotnetcli
dotnet publish -r win-x64
```

- **Review Warnings:**
  - Native AOT analysis includes all of the app's code and the libraries the app depends on. Review Native AOT warnings and take corrective steps. Test publishing apps frequently to identify issues early.

#### 2. Optimize Publish Size

##### Overview:
A Native AOT executable contains just the code from external dependencies required to support the app. Unused code is automatically trimmed away.

##### Key Points:
- **Create Slim Builder:**
  - Optimize the publish size of an ASP.NET Core gRPC service by creating the host builder with `WebApplication.CreateSlimBuilder()`. This builder provides a minimal list of features required by the app.

```csharp name=Program.cs
var builder = WebApplication.CreateSlimBuilder(args);

builder.Services.AddGrpc();

var app = builder.Build();

app.MapGrpcService<GreeterService>();

app.Run();
```

#### 3. Benefits of Using Native AOT

##### Overview:
Apps published with Native AOT have several benefits that improve performance and efficiency.

##### Key Points:
- **Minimized Disk Footprint:**
  - Native AOT reduces the size of the executable by including only the necessary code and trimming unused code.

- **Reduced Startup Time:**
  - Native AOT improves startup time by generating a native executable that does not require JIT compilation at runtime.

- **Reduced Memory Demand:**
  - Native AOT reduces memory usage by eliminating the need for the JIT compiler and minimizing the code footprint.
