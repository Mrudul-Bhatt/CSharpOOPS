### Versioning gRPC Services

The article "Versioning gRPC services" on Microsoft Docs provides guidance on how to manage changes to gRPC services over time, ensuring compatibility with existing clients and introducing versioning when necessary. Here are the key points explained:

#### 1. Backwards Compatibility

##### Overview:
The gRPC protocol is designed to support services that change over time, allowing for non-breaking changes that maintain compatibility with existing clients.

##### Key Points:
- **Non-Breaking Changes:**
  - Additions to gRPC services and methods are generally non-breaking.
  - Non-breaking changes allow existing clients to continue running without requiring updates.
  - Examples of non-breaking changes include:
    - Adding a new service.
    - Adding a new method to a service.
    - Adding a field to a request or response message.
    - Adding a value to an enum.
  - Example of adding a new field to a request message:

```protobuf name=greet.proto
syntax = "proto3";

message HelloRequest {
  string name = 1;
  string title = 2; // New field added
}
```

- **Binary Breaking Changes:**
  - Some changes are non-breaking at the gRPC protocol level but require client updates if they upgrade to the latest `.proto` contract or client .NET assembly.
  - Examples include:
    - Removing a field.
    - Renaming a message.
    - Nesting or unnesting a message.
    - Changing `csharp_namespace`.

- **Protocol Breaking Changes:**
  - Some changes are both protocol and binary breaking, requiring client updates and resulting in errors if not handled.
  - Examples include:
    - Renaming a field.
    - Changing a field data type.
    - Changing a field number.
    - Renaming a package, service, or method.
    - Removing a service or method.

- **Behavior Breaking Changes:**
  - Non-breaking changes at the protocol level may still result in behavior breaking changes.
  - Example: Adding a new field to a request message and requiring it to be set on the server side can break old clients that do not set the new field.

#### 2. Version Number Services

##### Overview:
When breaking changes are necessary, versioning gRPC services allows for the introduction of new versions while maintaining compatibility with older clients.

##### Key Points:
- **Versioning Strategy:**
  - Use version numbers in the package name to differentiate between versions of the service.
  - Example of versioned package names in `.proto` files:

```protobuf name=greet.v1.proto
syntax = "proto3";

package greet.v1;

service Greeter {
  rpc SayHello (HelloRequest) returns (HelloReply);
}

message HelloRequest {
  string name = 1;
}

message HelloReply {
  string message = 1;
}
```

```protobuf name=greet.v2.proto
syntax = "proto3";

package greet.v2;

service Greeter {
  rpc SayHello (HelloRequest) returns (HelloReply);
}

message HelloRequest {
  string name = 1;
  string title = 2; // New field added in v2
}

message HelloReply {
  string message = 1;
}
```

- **Service Address:**
  - The package name is combined with the service name to identify a service address.
  - Example service addresses:
    - `greet.v1.Greeter`
    - `greet.v2.Greeter`

- **Registering Versioned Services:**
  - Implementations of the versioned services are registered in `Startup.cs`:

```csharp name=Startup.cs
app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
{
    // Implements greet.v1.Greeter
    endpoints.MapGrpcService<GreeterServiceV1>();

    // Implements greet.v2.Greeter
    endpoints.MapGrpcService<GreeterServiceV2>();
});
```

- **Best Practices for Versioning:**
  - Avoid breaking changes if reasonable.
  - Do not update the version number unless making breaking changes.
  - Update the version number when making breaking changes.
  - To reduce duplication, consider moving business logic to a centralized location that can be reused by different versions.

- **Example of Centralized Business Logic:**
  - Centralize business logic and map messages to common types to reduce duplication in service implementations.

### Summary:

- **Backwards Compatibility:** Ensure non-breaking changes to maintain compatibility with existing clients. Handle binary and protocol breaking changes appropriately.
- **Version Number Services:** Use version numbers in package names to differentiate between service versions and register multiple versions side-by-side. Follow best practices to manage breaking changes and reduce duplication.
