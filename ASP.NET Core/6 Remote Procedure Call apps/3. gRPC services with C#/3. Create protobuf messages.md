I wasn't able to retrieve the file directly. However, I can summarize the key points based on my training data. Let's break down the article "Create Protobuf messages for .NET apps" in ASP.NET Core as mentioned on Microsoft Docs.

### Create Protobuf Messages for .NET Apps

#### 1. Protobuf Messages

##### Overview:
Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) are used to define the structure of the data that will be serialized and deserialized in gRPC communication. Protobuf messages are defined in `.proto` files and are used to generate the corresponding C# classes.

##### Key Points:
- **Define Messages in `.proto` File:**
  - Define the structure of messages using the Protobuf syntax in `.proto` files.
  - Example of a simple message definition:

```protobuf name=messages.proto
syntax = "proto3";

message Person {
  string name = 1;
  int32 id = 2;
  string email = 3;
}
```

- **Message Fields:**
  - Each field in the message is assigned a unique number (tag) and a data type.
  - Fields can be of various types, such as strings, integers, and custom message types.

#### 2. Scalar Value Types

##### Overview:
Protobuf supports a variety of scalar value types that can be used in message definitions. Scalar value types include basic data types such as integers, floating-point numbers, and strings.

##### Key Points:
- **Common Scalar Types:**
  - `int32`, `int64`: 32-bit and 64-bit signed integers.
  - `uint32`, `uint64`: 32-bit and 64-bit unsigned integers.
  - `float`, `double`: Floating-point numbers.
  - `bool`: Boolean values.
  - `string`: Strings.
  - `bytes`: Raw byte data.

- **Example of Scalar Types:**

```protobuf name=messages.proto
syntax = "proto3";

message Example {
  int32 age = 1;
  float score = 2;
  bool isActive = 3;
  string name = 4;
  bytes data = 5;
}
```

#### 3. Collections

##### Overview:
Protobuf supports collections, allowing you to define repeated fields in messages. Repeated fields are used to represent lists or arrays of values.

##### Key Points:
- **Repeated Fields:**
  - Use the `repeated` keyword to define a collection of values.
  - Collections can contain scalar types or custom message types.

- **Example of Repeated Fields:**

```protobuf name=messages.proto
syntax = "proto3";

message Student {
  string name = 1;
  repeated int32 grades = 2;
}

message Classroom {
  string className = 1;
  repeated Student students = 2;
}
```

- **Generated C# Code:**
  - The repeated fields are translated into collections (e.g., `List<T>`) in the generated C# classes.

#### 4. Unstructured and Conditional Messages

##### Overview:
Protobuf messages can include optional fields and oneof fields to represent unstructured and conditional data. Optional fields can be omitted, and oneof fields allow only one of the specified fields to be set at a time.

##### Key Points:
- **Optional Fields:**
  - In Protobuf 3, all fields are optional by default.

- **Oneof Fields:**
  - Use the `oneof` keyword to define fields where only one can be set at a time.
  - Example of oneof fields:

```protobuf name=messages.proto
syntax = "proto3";

message Shape {
  oneof shape_type {
    Circle circle = 1;
    Rectangle rectangle = 2;
  }
}

message Circle {
  float radius = 1;
}

message Rectangle {
  float width = 1;
  float height = 2;
}
```

- **Handling Oneof Fields in C#:**
  - The generated C# code includes properties and methods to check which field is set and to get the value of the set field.

### Summary:

- **Protobuf Messages:** Define the structure of messages in `.proto` files using the Protobuf syntax.
- **Scalar Value Types:** Use common scalar types such as integers, floating-point numbers, and strings in message definitions.
- **Collections:** Define repeated fields to represent lists or arrays of values.
- **Unstructured and Conditional Messages:** Use optional fields and oneof fields to represent unstructured and conditional data.
