### Test gRPC Services with gRPCurl and gRPCui in ASP.NET Core

The article "Test gRPC services with gRPCurl and gRPCui in ASP.NET Core" provides guidance on using gRPCurl and gRPCui to test gRPC services without building client apps. Here are the key points explained:

#### 1. Set up gRPC Reflection

##### Overview:
Tooling must know the Protobuf contract of services before it can call them. This can be achieved by setting up gRPC reflection on the server or manually adding `.proto` files to the tool.

##### Key Points:
- **gRPC Reflection:**
  - gRPC reflection adds a new gRPC service to the app that clients can call to discover services.
  - It is easier to use gRPC reflection compared to manually adding `.proto` files.

- **Add Package Reference:**
  - Add a `Grpc.AspNetCore.Server.Reflection` package reference to your project.

```xml name=GrpcServiceReflection.csproj
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net6.0</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Grpc.AspNetCore.Server.Reflection" Version="2.40.0" />
  </ItemGroup>

</Project>
```

- **Register Reflection in `Program.cs`:**
  - Use `AddGrpcReflection` to register services that enable reflection.
  - Use `MapGrpcReflectionService` to add a reflection service endpoint.

```csharp name=Program.cs
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.Services.AddGrpc();
builder.Services.AddGrpcReflection();

var app = builder.Build();
app.MapGrpcService<GreeterService>();
app.MapGrpcReflectionService();

app.Run();
```

- **Reflection Service Security:**
  - Limit access to the gRPC reflection service to protect potentially sensitive information.

```csharp
app.MapGrpcReflectionService().RequireAuthorization("ReflectionPolicy");
```

#### 2. gRPCurl

##### Overview:
gRPCurl is an open-source command-line tool that provides interaction with gRPC services. It allows developers to discover and test gRPC services.

##### Key Points:
- **Command-line Tool:**
  - gRPCurl is used to call gRPC services from the command line.

- **Discover Services:**
  - Use gRPCurl to list available services and methods.

```bash
grpcurl -plaintext localhost:5001 list
```

- **Call Methods:**
  - Use gRPCurl to call specific methods on a gRPC service.

```bash
grpcurl -d '{"name": "World"}' -plaintext localhost:5001 greet.Greeter/SayHello
```

#### 3. gRPCui

##### Overview:
gRPCui builds on top of gRPCurl and adds an open-source interactive web UI for gRPC. It allows developers to interact with gRPC services via a browser.

##### Key Points:
- **Interactive Web UI:**
  - gRPCui provides a web-based interface for calling gRPC services.

- **Start gRPCui:**
  - Use gRPCui to start a web UI for interacting with gRPC services.

```bash
grpcui -plaintext localhost:5001
```

- **Browser Interface:**
  - Access the gRPCui interface in a web browser to discover and call gRPC services interactively.
