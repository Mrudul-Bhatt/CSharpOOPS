### Performance Best Practices with gRPC (Continued)

#### 5. Inter-process Communication

##### Overview:
gRPC calls between a client and service are typically sent over TCP sockets. While TCP is great for communicating across a network, there are more efficient options for inter-process communication (IPC) on the same machine.

##### Key Points:
- **IPC Transports:**
  - Consider using Unix domain sockets or named pipes for gRPC calls between processes on the same machine.
  - These transports provide lower latency and higher throughput compared to TCP for local communication.

- **Configuration:**
  - For more information on IPC transports, see the guidance on [gRPC interprocess communication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/grpc/interprocess).

#### 6. Keep Alive Pings

##### Overview:
Keep alive pings help keep HTTP/2 connections alive during periods of inactivity. This ensures that an existing connection is ready when an app resumes activity.

##### Key Points:
- **Configuration:**
  - Configure keep alive pings on `SocketsHttpHandler`.

```csharp
var handler = new SocketsHttpHandler
{
    PooledConnectionIdleTimeout = Timeout.InfiniteTimeSpan,
    KeepAlivePingDelay = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(60),
    KeepAlivePingTimeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30),
    EnableMultipleHttp2Connections = true
};

var channel = GrpcChannel.ForAddress("https://localhost:5001", new GrpcChannelOptions
{
    HttpHandler = handler
});
```

- **Ping Interval:**
  - The example configures a channel that sends a keep alive ping every 60 seconds during inactivity to ensure the server and any proxies do not close the connection.

- **Note:**
  - Keep alive pings help keep the connection alive, but long-running gRPC calls on the connection may still be terminated by the server or intermediary proxies due to inactivity.

#### 7. Flow Control

##### Overview:
HTTP/2 flow control prevents apps from being overwhelmed with data by managing the amount of data that can be sent and received at once.

##### Key Points:
- **Flow Control Mechanism:**
  - Each HTTP/2 connection and request has an available buffer window that controls how much data can be received at once.
  - Flow control activates if the buffer window is filled up, pausing data transmission until space is available.

- **Performance Impact:**
  - Flow control can negatively impact performance when receiving large messages. Increasing the buffer window size can help mitigate this issue.

- **Configuration:**
  - In Kestrel, configure flow control with `Http2Limits.InitialConnectionWindowSize` and `Http2Limits.InitialStreamWindowSize`.

```csharp
builder.WebHost.ConfigureKestrel(options =>
{
    var http2 = options.Limits.Http2;
    http2.InitialConnectionWindowSize = 1024 * 1024 * 2; // 2 MB
    http2.InitialStreamWindowSize = 1024 * 1024; // 1 MB
});
```

- **Recommendations:**
  - Increase the connection and stream window size if the service often receives messages larger than 768 KB.
  - Ensure the connection window size is equal to or greater than the stream window size to avoid limitations.

- **Important:**
  - Increasing the window size allows Kestrel to buffer more data, which can increase memory usage. Avoid configuring an unnecessarily large window size.

#### 8. Gracefully Complete Streaming Calls

##### Overview:
Gracefully completing streaming calls avoids unnecessary errors and allows servers to reuse internal data structures between requests.

##### Key Points:
- **Graceful Completion:**
  - A call is completed gracefully when both the client and server have finished sending messages and the peer has read all the messages.

- **Client Request Stream:**
  1. The client completes the request stream with `call.RequestStream.CompleteAsync()`.
  2. The server reads all messages from the request stream, which completes the stream.

- **Server Response Stream:**
  1. The server completes the response stream by exiting the server method.
  2. The client reads all messages from the response stream, which completes the stream.

- **Example:**
  - For an example of gracefully completing a bi-directional streaming call, see the guidance on [making a bi-directional streaming call](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/grpc/client#bi-directional-streaming-call).

- **Server Streaming Calls:**
  - Server streaming calls do not have a request stream. The client can communicate to the server to stop the stream by canceling it.

### Summary:

- **Inter-process Communication:** Use Unix domain sockets or named pipes for efficient local communication.
- **Keep Alive Pings:** Configure keep alive pings to keep HTTP/2 connections alive during inactivity.
- **Flow Control:** Manage data flow with buffer windows to avoid being overwhelmed with data.
- **Gracefully Complete Streaming Calls:** Gracefully complete streaming calls to avoid errors and improve server efficiency.
