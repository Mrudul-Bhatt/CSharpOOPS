### gRPC Client-Side Load Balancing

The article "gRPC client-side load balancing" on Microsoft Docs provides guidance on how to configure client-side load balancing for gRPC clients in .NET. Here are the key points explained:

#### 1. Configure gRPC Client-Side Load Balancing

##### Overview:
Client-side load balancing allows gRPC clients to distribute load optimally across available servers, making gRPC applications more scalable and high-performance.

##### Key Points:
- **Components:**
  - **Resolver:** Determines the addresses for the channel, supporting service discovery.
  - **Load Balancer:** Creates connections and selects the address for gRPC calls.

- **Configuration:**
  - Client-side load balancing is configured when a channel is created.
  - Example setup:

```csharp
var channel = GrpcChannel.ForAddress("dns:///my-example-host", new GrpcChannelOptions { Credentials = ChannelCredentials.Insecure });
```

- **Dependency Injection (DI):**
  - Some load balancing configurations use DI.
  - Apps without DI can create a `ServiceCollection` instance.
  - If DI is already set up, register types with the existing DI instance and configure `GrpcChannelOptions.ServiceProvider` accordingly.

#### 2. Configure Resolver

##### Overview:
The resolver is responsible for resolving the addresses for the channel. The URI scheme of the address specifies the resolver to use.

##### Key Points:
- **Built-in Resolvers:**
  - **DNS Resolver:** Resolves addresses by querying the hostname for DNS address records.
  - **Static Resolver:** Resolves addresses specified by the app, recommended if the app already knows the addresses it calls.

- **Example Configuration:**
  - For a DNS resolver:

```csharp
var channel = GrpcChannel.ForAddress("dns:///my-example-host", new GrpcChannelOptions { Credentials = ChannelCredentials.Insecure });
```

  - The `dns` scheme maps to `DnsResolverFactory`, which queries DNS for `my-example-host` and retrieves addresses like `127.0.0.100` and `127.0.0.101`.

#### 3. Configure Load Balancer

##### Overview:
The load balancer creates connections and selects the address that a gRPC call will use. Built-in load balancers are included in `Grpc.Net.Client`.

##### Key Points:
- **Built-in Load Balancers:**
  - The `Grpc.Net.Client` package includes built-in implementations for load balancing.
  - Load balancing can also be extended by writing custom resolvers and load balancers.

- **Example Configuration:**
  - Configure the load balancer when creating the channel. The load balancer uses the addresses resolved by the resolver.

#### 4. Configure Channel Credentials

##### Overview:
Channel credentials are used to configure the security of the gRPC channel. This includes whether the channel uses insecure or secure connections.

##### Key Points:
- **Secure and Insecure Connections:**
  - Use `ChannelCredentials.Insecure` for insecure connections.
  - For secure connections, configure the channel with appropriate credentials.

- **Example Configuration:**
  - For an insecure connection:

```csharp
var channel = GrpcChannel.ForAddress("dns:///my-example-host", new GrpcChannelOptions { Credentials = ChannelCredentials.Insecure });
```

  - For a secure connection, replace `ChannelCredentials.Insecure` with the appropriate secure credentials.

### Summary:

- **Configure gRPC Client-Side Load Balancing:** Set up client-side load balancing by configuring the resolver and load balancer when creating a channel.
- **Configure Resolver:** Use the URI scheme to specify the resolver, such as `dns` or `static`.
- **Configure Load Balancer:** Use built-in load balancers or write custom ones to distribute gRPC calls across servers.
- **Configure Channel Credentials:** Set the channel credentials to manage the security of the gRPC channel.
