### Mock gRPC Client in Tests

The article "Mock gRPC client in tests" on Microsoft Docs provides guidance on how to mock gRPC clients in .NET tests to create stable and maintainable software. Here are the key points explained:

#### 1. Example Testable Client App

##### Overview:
The example demonstrates how to create a testable client application that makes calls to a gRPC server using a `BackgroundService`.

##### Key Points:
- **Worker Class:**
  - The `Worker` class is a `BackgroundService` that makes gRPC calls.
  - Example code snippet of the `Worker` class:

```csharp
public class Worker : BackgroundService
{
    private readonly ILogger<Worker> _logger;
    private readonly Tester.TesterClient _client;
    private readonly IGreetRepository _repository;

    public Worker(ILogger<Worker> logger, Tester.TesterClient client, IGreetRepository repository)
    {
        _logger = logger;
        _client = client;
        _repository = repository;
    }

    protected override async Task ExecuteAsync(CancellationToken stoppingToken)
    {
        while (!stoppingToken.IsCancellationRequested)
        {
            var reply = await _client.SayHelloAsync(new HelloRequest { Name = "Worker" });
            _repository.SaveGreeting(reply.Message);
            _logger.LogInformation("Worker running at: {time}", DateTimeOffset.Now);
            await Task.Delay(1000, stoppingToken);
        }
    }
}
```

- **Principles Followed:**
  - The `Worker` class follows the Explicit Dependencies Principle.
  - `TesterClient` is generated by the `Grpc.Tools` package based on the `.proto` file.
  - Dependency Injection (DI) is used to provide instances of `TesterClient` and `IGreetRepository`.
  - The app is configured to use the gRPC client factory.

- **Testability:**
  - The `Worker` class can be tested using a mocked `IGreetRepository` and `TesterClient` with a mocking framework like Moq.

#### 2. Mock a gRPC Client

##### Overview:
Mocking a gRPC client allows tests to use mocked methods instead of sending actual gRPC calls to a server.

##### Key Points:
- **Generated gRPC Clients:**
  - gRPC clients are generated from `.proto` files and have methods corresponding to the gRPC service.

- **Using Mocking Framework:**
  - A mocking framework can be used to mock gRPC client types.
  - Example unit test using Moq:

```csharp
public class WorkerTests
{
    [Fact]
    public async Task ExecuteAsync_CallsSaveGreeting()
    {
        // Arrange
        var mockLogger = new Mock<ILogger<Worker>>();
        var mockClient = new Mock<Tester.TesterClient>();
        var mockRepository = new Mock<IGreetRepository>();

        mockClient
            .Setup(client => client.SayHelloAsync(It.IsAny<HelloRequest>(), null, null, It.IsAny<CancellationToken>()))
            .ReturnsAsync(new HelloReply { Message = "Hello, Worker" });

        var worker = new Worker(mockLogger.Object, mockClient.Object, mockRepository.Object);

        // Act
        await worker.StartAsync(CancellationToken.None);

        // Assert
        mockRepository.Verify(repo => repo.SaveGreeting("Hello, Worker"), Times.Once);
    }
}
```

- **Explanation of the Code:**
  - Mocks `IGreetRepository` and `TesterClient` using Moq.
  - Starts the worker.
  - Verifies that `SaveGreeting` is called with the message returned by the mocked `TesterClient`.

### Summary:

- **Example Testable Client App:** Demonstrates how to create a testable client application using a `BackgroundService` that makes gRPC calls.
- **Mock a gRPC Client:** Explains how to use a mocking framework to mock gRPC clients and write unit tests that use mocked methods instead of actual gRPC calls.
