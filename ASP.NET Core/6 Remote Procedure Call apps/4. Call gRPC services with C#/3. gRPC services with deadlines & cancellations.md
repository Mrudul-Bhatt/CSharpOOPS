### Reliable gRPC Services with Deadlines and Cancellation

The article "Reliable gRPC services with deadlines and cancellation" on Microsoft Docs provides guidance on how to use deadlines and cancellation in gRPC services to create more reliable applications. Here are the key points explained:

#### 1. Deadlines

##### Overview:
Deadlines allow a gRPC client to specify how long it will wait for a call to complete. If the deadline is exceeded, the call is canceled. This is crucial for preventing calls from running indefinitely and consuming resources.

##### Key Points:
- **Configuring Deadlines:**
  - Use `CallOptions.Deadline` to set a deadline when making a gRPC call.
  - Deadlines are not set by default; they must be specified explicitly.
  - A deadline is an absolute UTC time, such as `DateTime.UtcNow.AddSeconds(5)` for a 5-second deadline.

- **Behavior When Exceeded:**
  - **Client Behavior:**
    - The client aborts the HTTP request and throws a `DeadlineExceeded` error.
    - The client application can catch this error and handle it, such as displaying a timeout message to the user.
  - **Server Behavior:**
    - The server's HTTP request is aborted, and `ServerCallContext.CancellationToken` is triggered.
    - The server can use this token to stop processing and clean up resources.

- **Code Example:**
  - Setting a deadline on the client side:

```csharp name=deadline-client.cs
var callOptions = new CallOptions().WithDeadline(DateTime.UtcNow.AddSeconds(5));
var response = await client.SayHelloAsync(new HelloRequest { Name = "World" }, callOptions);
```

  - Using `ServerCallContext.CancellationToken` on the server side:

```csharp name=deadline-server.cs
public override async Task<HelloReply> SayHello(HelloRequest request, ServerCallContext context)
{
    // Use the cancellation token to abort work if the deadline is exceeded
    context.CancellationToken.ThrowIfCancellationRequested();
    // Implement the service logic
    return new HelloReply { Message = "Hello " + request.Name };
}
```

- **Deadlines and Retries:**
  - When using retries, the deadline tracks time across all retries. If the deadline is exceeded, the call is aborted even if it is in the middle of a retry.

- **Propagating Deadlines:**
  - When a gRPC service makes another gRPC call, the original deadline should be propagated to the new call.
  - Manually propagating deadlines can be cumbersome, but this can be automated using the gRPC client factory.
  - Example of propagating deadlines:

```csharp name=deadline-propagate.cs
public override async Task<HelloReply> SayHello(HelloRequest request, ServerCallContext context)
{
    var deadline = context.Deadline;
    var callOptions = new CallOptions().WithDeadline(deadline);
    var response = await client.SayHelloAsync(new HelloRequest { Name = "World" }, callOptions);
    return response;
}
```

#### 2. Cancellation

##### Overview:
Cancellation allows a gRPC client to cancel long-running calls that are no longer needed. This is useful for improving responsiveness and resource management.

##### Key Points:
- **Canceling gRPC Calls on the Client:**
  - You can cancel a gRPC call by passing a cancellation token using `CallOptions.CancellationToken`.
  - Alternatively, you can call `Dispose` on the call to cancel it.
  - Example of canceling a gRPC call:

```csharp name=cancellation-client.cs
var cts = new CancellationTokenSource();
var callOptions = new CallOptions().WithCancellationToken(cts.Token);
var call = client.SayHelloAsync(new HelloRequest { Name = "World" }, callOptions);

// Cancel the call if needed
cts.Cancel();
```

- **Handling Cancellation on the Server:**
  - gRPC services should handle cancellation by using `ServerCallContext.CancellationToken`.
  - This allows the server to stop processing and clean up resources when the client cancels the call.
  - Example of handling cancellation on the server side:

```csharp name=cancellation-server.cs
public override async Task<HelloReply> SayHello(HelloRequest request, ServerCallContext context)
{
    // Use the cancellation token to abort work if the client cancels the call
    context.CancellationToken.ThrowIfCancellationRequested();
    // Implement the service logic
    return new HelloReply { Message = "Hello " + request.Name };
}
```

- **Propagating Cancellation Tokens:**
  - Cancellation tokens should be propagated to child calls to ensure that all related calls are canceled together.
  - This can be automated using the gRPC client factory with `EnableCallContextPropagation`.

### Summary:

- **Deadlines:** Set deadlines to limit the duration of gRPC calls and prevent them from running indefinitely. Use `CallOptions.Deadline` on the client side and `ServerCallContext.CancellationToken` on the server side to handle deadlines.
- **Cancellation:** Allow clients to cancel long-running gRPC calls using cancellation tokens. Handle cancellation on the server side using `ServerCallContext.CancellationToken` and propagate tokens to child calls.
