### Transient Fault Handling with gRPC Retries

The article "Transient fault handling with gRPC retries" on Microsoft Docs provides guidance on how to configure gRPC retries and hedging to handle transient faults in .NET applications. Here are the key points explained:

#### 1. Transient Fault Handling

##### Overview:
Transient faults are temporary issues that can interrupt gRPC calls. These faults can include momentary loss of network connectivity, temporary unavailability of a service, and timeouts due to server load.

##### Key Points:
- **Handling Transient Faults:**
  - When a gRPC call is interrupted by a transient fault, the client throws an `RpcException` with details about the error.
  - The client application must catch the exception and decide how to handle it, such as retrying the call.
  - Example of handling a transient fault:

```csharp
var client = new Greeter.GreeterClient(channel);
try
{
    var response = await client.SayHelloAsync(new HelloRequest { Name = ".NET" });
    Console.WriteLine("From server: " + response.Message);
}
catch (RpcException ex)
{
    // Write logic to inspect the error and retry if the error is from a transient fault.
}
```

- **Automatic Retries:**
  - Manually duplicating retry logic throughout an application is error-prone.
  - The .NET gRPC client has built-in support for automatic retries, which simplifies the process.

#### 2. Configure a gRPC Retry Policy

##### Overview:
A retry policy allows gRPC clients to automatically retry failed calls based on specific criteria. This helps to make gRPC calls more resilient and fault-tolerant.

##### Key Points:
- **Configure Retry Policy:**
  - A retry policy is configured once when a gRPC channel is created.
  - Example of configuring a retry policy:

```csharp
var defaultMethodConfig = new MethodConfig
{
    Names = { MethodName.Default },
    RetryPolicy = new RetryPolicy
    {
        MaxAttempts = 5,
        InitialBackoff = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1),
        MaxBackoff = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5),
        BackoffMultiplier = 1.5,
        RetryableStatusCodes = { StatusCode.Unavailable }
    }
};

var channel = GrpcChannel.ForAddress("https://localhost:5001", new GrpcChannelOptions
{
    ServiceConfig = new ServiceConfig { MethodConfigs = { defaultMethodConfig } }
});
```

- **Retry Policy Details:**
  - `MaxAttempts`: The maximum number of call attempts, including the original attempt.
  - `InitialBackoff`: The initial backoff delay between retry attempts.
  - `MaxBackoff`: The maximum backoff delay.
  - `BackoffMultiplier`: The multiplier for exponential backoff.
  - `RetryableStatusCodes`: A collection of status codes that trigger a retry.

- **When Retries are Valid:**
  - Retries are valid if the failing status code matches a value in `RetryableStatusCodes`, the number of attempts is less than `MaxAttempts`, the call hasn't been committed, and the deadline hasn't been exceeded.

#### 3. Hedging

##### Overview:
Hedging is an alternative retry strategy that involves sending multiple copies of a single gRPC call without waiting for a response. This can improve the chances of getting a successful response quickly.

##### Key Points:
- **Pros and Cons of Hedging:**
  - **Pros:**
    - Hedging might return a successful result faster by allowing multiple simultaneous gRPC calls.
  - **Cons:**
    - Hedging can be wasteful, as multiple successful calls might be made and only the first result is used while the rest are discarded.

#### 4. Configure a gRPC Hedging Policy

##### Overview:
A hedging policy is configured similarly to a retry policy, but it cannot be combined with a retry policy. Hedging policies enable the sending of multiple copies of a gRPC call.

##### Key Points:
- **Configure Hedging Policy:**
  - Example of configuring a hedging policy:

```csharp
var defaultMethodConfig = new MethodConfig
{
    Names = { MethodName.Default },
    HedgingPolicy = new HedgingPolicy
    {
        MaxAttempts = 5,
        NonFatalStatusCodes = { StatusCode.Unavailable }
    }
};

var channel = GrpcChannel.ForAddress("https://localhost:5001", new GrpcChannelOptions
{
    ServiceConfig = new ServiceConfig { MethodConfigs = { defaultMethodConfig } }
});
```

- **Hedging Policy Details:**
  - `MaxAttempts`: The maximum number of call attempts, including the original attempt.
  - `HedgingDelay`: The delay between sending hedged calls.
  - `NonFatalStatusCodes`: A collection of status codes that indicate other hedge calls may still succeed.

### Summary:

- **Transient Fault Handling:** Handle transient faults by catching `RpcException` and using automatic retries.
- **Configure a gRPC Retry Policy:** Configure retry policies to automatically retry failed gRPC calls based on specific criteria.
- **Hedging:** Use hedging to send multiple copies of a gRPC call to improve the chances of a successful response quickly.
- **Configure a gRPC Hedging Policy:** Configure hedging policies to send multiple copies of a gRPC call, with options for maximum attempts and delay between calls.
