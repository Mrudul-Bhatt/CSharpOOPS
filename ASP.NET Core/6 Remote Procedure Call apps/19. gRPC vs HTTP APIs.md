### Compare gRPC Services with HTTP APIs

The article "Compare gRPC services with HTTP APIs" provides a detailed comparison between gRPC services and HTTP APIs with JSON, including their strengths, recommended scenarios, weaknesses, and alternative framework scenarios. Here are the key points explained:

#### 1. High-level Comparison

##### Overview:
This section offers a high-level comparison of various features between gRPC and HTTP APIs with JSON.

##### Key Points:
- **Contract:**
  - gRPC: Requires a `.proto` file.
  - HTTP APIs: Optional, typically uses OpenAPI.

- **Protocol:**
  - gRPC: Uses HTTP/2.
  - HTTP APIs: Uses HTTP.

- **Payload:**
  - gRPC: Uses Protobuf, which is a small and efficient binary format.
  - HTTP APIs: Uses JSON, which is larger and human-readable.

- **Prescriptiveness:**
  - gRPC: Has a strict specification.
  - HTTP APIs: Loose, any valid HTTP is acceptable.

- **Streaming:**
  - gRPC: Supports client, server, and bi-directional streaming.
  - HTTP APIs: Supports client and server streaming.

- **Browser Support:**
  - gRPC: No direct browser support; requires grpc-web.
  - HTTP APIs: Supported by all browsers.

- **Security:**
  - Both use Transport Layer Security (TLS).

- **Client Code-generation:**
  - gRPC: Yes, with built-in support.
  - HTTP APIs: Supported via OpenAPI and third-party tooling.

#### 2. gRPC Strengths

##### Overview:
This section highlights the strengths and advantages of using gRPC.

##### Key Points:
- **Performance:**
  - gRPC uses Protobuf for message serialization, which is efficient and lightweight.
  - Designed for HTTP/2, offering benefits like binary framing, compression, and multiplexing.

- **Code Generation:**
  - Provides first-class support for code generation from `.proto` files.
  - Eliminates duplication of messages and ensures consistency between server and client.

- **Strict Specification:**
  - The gRPC specification is prescriptive, reducing debates over formats and saving developer time.

- **Streaming:**
  - Supports all streaming combinations, including unary, server-to-client, client-to-server, and bi-directional streaming.

- **Deadline/Timeouts and Cancellation:**
  - Allows clients to specify deadlines and propagate cancellation through child gRPC calls for better resource management.

#### 3. gRPC Recommended Scenarios

##### Overview:
This section lists scenarios where gRPC is particularly well-suited.

##### Key Points:
- **Microservices:**
  - Ideal for low latency and high throughput communication.

- **Point-to-point Real-time Communication:**
  - Excellent support for bi-directional streaming.

- **Polyglot Environments:**
  - Supports all popular development languages.

- **Network Constrained Environments:**
  - Efficient Protobuf serialization results in smaller message sizes.

- **Inter-process Communication (IPC):**
  - Can use IPC transports like Unix domain sockets and named pipes for communication between apps on the same machine.

#### 4. gRPC Weaknesses

##### Overview:
This section discusses the limitations and weaknesses of gRPC.

##### Key Points:
- **Limited Browser Support:**
  - Direct calls to gRPC services from a browser are not possible.
  - Solutions include gRPC-Web (requiring a gRPC client) and gRPC JSON transcoding (requiring .NET 7 or later).

- **Not Human Readable:**
  - Protobuf messages are efficient but not human-readable.
  - Requires the message's interface description to be understood.

#### 5. Alternative Framework Scenarios

##### Overview:
This section suggests scenarios where other frameworks might be more suitable than gRPC.

##### Key Points:
- **Browser Accessible APIs:**
  - gRPC is not fully supported in browsers. gRPC-Web introduces limitations and requires a server proxy.

- **Broadcast Real-time Communication:**
  - gRPC supports real-time communication via streaming but lacks the concept of broadcasting messages to multiple connections.
