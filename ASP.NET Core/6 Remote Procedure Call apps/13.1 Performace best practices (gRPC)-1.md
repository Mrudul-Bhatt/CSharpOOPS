### Performance Best Practices with gRPC

The article "Performance best practices with gRPC" provides guidance on how to optimize performance when building gRPC services. Here are the first four key points explained:

#### 1. Reuse gRPC Channels

##### Overview:
A gRPC channel should be reused when making gRPC calls. Reusing a channel allows calls to be multiplexed through an existing HTTP/2 connection, improving performance.

##### Key Points:
- **Channel Reuse:**
  - Reusing channels prevents the overhead associated with creating new connections for each call, which includes opening a socket, establishing a TCP connection, negotiating TLS, and starting an HTTP/2 connection.
  
- **Benefits:**
  - Channels are safe to share and reuse between gRPC calls.
  - Multiple gRPC clients can be created from a single channel.
  - A channel and its clients can be used by multiple threads.
  - Clients created from the channel can make multiple simultaneous calls.

- **gRPC Client Factory:**
  - Offers a centralized way to configure channels and automatically reuses underlying channels.

#### 2. Connection Concurrency

##### Overview:
HTTP/2 connections typically have a limit on the number of maximum concurrent streams (active HTTP requests) on a connection at one time.

##### Key Points:
- **Concurrency Limits:**
  - A gRPC channel uses a single HTTP/2 connection, and concurrent calls are multiplexed on that connection.
  - When the number of active calls reaches the connection stream limit, additional calls are queued.

- **Multiple HTTP/2 Connections (ASP.NET Core 5.0+):**
  - .NET 5 introduces the `SocketsHttpHandler.EnableMultipleHttp2Connections` property, which allows additional HTTP/2 connections to be created when the concurrent stream limit is reached.

```csharp
var channel = GrpcChannel.ForAddress("https://localhost", new GrpcChannelOptions
{
    HttpHandler = new SocketsHttpHandler
    {
        EnableMultipleHttp2Connections = true,
        // ...configure other handler settings
    }
});
```

- **Workarounds for .NET Core 3.1:**
  - Create separate gRPC channels for high-load areas of the app.
  - Use a pool of gRPC channels and randomly distribute calls among them.

- **Server Configuration:**
  - Increasing the maximum concurrent stream limit on the server is another way to address this issue, but it is not recommended due to potential performance issues.

#### 3. `ServerGarbageCollection` in Client Apps

##### Overview:
The .NET garbage collector has two modes: workstation garbage collection (GC) and server garbage collection. Each is tuned for different workloads.

##### Key Points:
- **Server GC:**
  - Highly concurrent apps generally perform better with server GC.
  - If a gRPC client app is sending and receiving a high number of gRPC calls simultaneously, enabling server GC may provide a performance benefit.

- **Configuration:**
  - Enable server GC by setting `<ServerGarbageCollection>` in the app's project file.

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <ServerGarbageCollection>true</ServerGarbageCollection>
</PropertyGroup>
```

- **Note:**
  - ASP.NET Core apps use server GC by default. Enabling `<ServerGarbageCollection>` is only useful in non-server gRPC client apps, such as client console apps.

#### 4. Load Balancing

##### Overview:
Some load balancers do not work effectively with gRPC due to its use of HTTP/2, which multiplexes multiple calls on a single TCP connection.

##### Key Points:
- **Challenges with L4 Load Balancers:**
  - L4 (transport) load balancers distribute TCP connections across endpoints but do not work well with gRPC because all calls over a single TCP connection go to one endpoint.

- **Effective Load Balancing Options:**
  - **Client-Side Load Balancing:**
    - The client knows about endpoints and selects a different endpoint for each gRPC call.
    - Suitable for scenarios where latency and performance are critical.
  
  - **L7 (Application) Proxy Load Balancing:**
    - Works at a higher level and understands HTTP/2.
    - The proxy receives gRPC calls multiplexed on one HTTP/2 connection and distributes them across endpoints.
    - Examples of L7 proxies include Envoy, Linkerd, and YARP (Yet Another Reverse Proxy).

# Performance Best Practices with gRPC

## Reuse gRPC Channels

A gRPC channel should be reused when making gRPC calls. Reusing a channel allows calls to be multiplexed through an existing HTTP/2 connection.

If a new channel is created for each gRPC call then the amount of time it takes to complete can increase significantly. Each call will require multiple network round-trips between the client and the server:

1. Opening a socket
2. Establishing TCP connection
3. Negotiating TLS
4. Starting HTTP/2 connection
5. Making the gRPC call

Channels are safe to share and reuse between gRPC calls:

* gRPC clients are created with channels. gRPC clients are lightweight objects and don't need to be cached or reused.
* Multiple gRPC clients can be created from a channel, including different types of clients.
* A channel and clients created from the channel can safely be used by multiple threads.
* Clients created from the channel can make multiple simultaneous calls.

gRPC client factory offers a centralized way to configure channels. It automatically reuses underlying channels. For more information, see <xref:grpc/clientfactory>.

## Connection Concurrency

HTTP/2 connections typically have a limit on the number of [maximum concurrent streams (active HTTP requests)](https://httpwg.github.io/specs/rfc7540.html#rfc.section.5.1.2) on a connection at one time.

A gRPC channel uses a single HTTP/2 connection, and concurrent calls are multiplexed on that connection. When the number of active calls reaches the connection stream limit, additional calls are queued.

### .NET 5 and Later

.NET 5 introduces the <xref:System.Net.Http.SocketsHttpHandler.EnableMultipleHttp2Connections?displayProperty=nameWithType> property. When set to `true`, additional HTTP/2 connections are created when the concurrent stream limit is reached.

```csharp
var channel = GrpcChannel.ForAddress("https://localhost", new GrpcChannelOptions
{
    HttpHandler = new SocketsHttpHandler
    {
        EnableMultipleHttp2Connections = true,

        // ...configure other handler settings
    }
});
```

### .NET Core 3.1

There are a couple of workarounds for .NET Core 3.1 apps:

* Create separate gRPC channels for areas of the app with high load. For example, the `Logger` gRPC service might have a high load. Use a separate channel to create the `LoggerClient` in the app.
* Use a pool of gRPC channels, for example, create a list of gRPC channels. `Random` is used to pick a channel from the list each time a gRPC channel is needed. Using `Random` randomly distributes calls among channels.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Increasing the maximum concurrent stream limit on the server is another way to solve this problem. In Kestrel this is configured with <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core.Http2Limits.MaxConcurrentStreams>.
>
> Increasing the maximum concurrent stream limit is not recommended. Too many streams on a single HTTP/2 connection introduces new performance issues:
>
> * Thread contention between streams trying to write to the connection.
> * Connection packet loss causes all calls to be blocked at the TCP layer.

## `ServerGarbageCollection` in Client Apps

The .NET garbage collector has two modes: workstation garbage collection (GC) and server garbage collection. Each is each tuned for different workloads. ASP.NET Core apps use server GC by default.

Highly concurrent apps generally perform better with server GC. If a gRPC client app is sending and receiving a high number of gRPC calls at the same time, then there may be a performance benefit to enabling server GC.

To enable server GC, set `<ServerGarbageCollection>` in the app's project file:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <ServerGarbageCollection>true</ServerGarbageCollection>
</PropertyGroup>
```

For more information about garbage collection, see [Workstation and server garbage collection](/dotnet/standard/garbage-collection/workstation-server-gc).

> [!NOTE]
> ASP.NET Core apps use server GC by default. Enabling `<ServerGarbageCollection>` is only useful in non-server gRPC client apps, for example in a gRPC client console app.

## Load Balancing

Some load balancers don't work effectively with gRPC. L4 (transport) load balancers operate at a connection level, by distributing TCP connections across endpoints. This approach works well for load balancing HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/1.0 requests.

Because L4 load balancers operate at a connection level, they don't work well with gRPC. gRPC uses HTTP/2, which multiplexes multiple calls on a single TCP connection. All gRPC calls over that connection are sent to one endpoint.

There are two options to effectively load balance gRPC:

* Client-side load balancing
* L7 (application) proxy load balancing

> [!NOTE]
> Only gRPC calls can be load balanced between endpoints. Once a streaming gRPC call is established, all messages sent over the stream go to one endpoint.

### Client-Side Load Balancing

With client-side load balancing, the client knows about endpoints. For each gRPC call, it selects a different endpoint to send the call to. Client-side load balancing is a good choice when latency and performance are critical.

Lookaside client load balancing is a technique where load balancing state is stored in a central location. Clients periodically query the central location for information to use when making load balancing decisions.

For more information, see <xref:grpc/loadbalancing>.

### Proxy Load Balancing

An L7 (application) proxy works at a higher level than an L4 (transport) proxy. L7 proxies understand HTTP/2. The proxy receives gRPC calls multiplexed on one HTTP/2 connection and distributes them across endpoints.

There are many L7 proxies available. Some options are:

* [Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/) - A popular open source proxy.
* [Linkerd](https://linkerd.io/) - Service mesh for Kubernetes.
* [YARP: Yet Another Reverse Proxy](https://dotnet.github.io/yarp/) - An open source proxy written in .NET.
