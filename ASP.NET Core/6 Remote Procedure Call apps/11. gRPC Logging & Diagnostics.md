### Logging and Diagnostics in gRPC on .NET

The article "Logging and diagnostics in gRPC on .NET" provides guidance on gathering diagnostics from your gRPC app to help troubleshoot issues. Here are the key points explained:

#### 1. Logging

##### Overview:
gRPC services and the gRPC client write logs using .NET Core logging. Logs are a good place to start when debugging unexpected behavior in service and client applications.

##### Key Points:
- **gRPC Services Logging:**
  - Since gRPC services are hosted on ASP.NET Core, they use the ASP.NET Core logging system. By default, gRPC logs minimal information, but logging can be configured to provide more detailed information.

```json name=logging-config.json
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Grpc": "Debug"
    }
  }
}
```

```csharp name=Program.cs
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.Logging.SetMinimumLevel(LogLevel.Debug);
builder.Logging.AddJsonConsole();

var app = builder.Build();
app.MapGrpcService<GreeterService>();
app.Run();
```

- **Sample Logging Output:**
  - Example of console output at the `Debug` level of a gRPC service:

```console
info: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.Diagnostics[1]
      Request starting HTTP/2 POST https://localhost:5001/Greet.Greeter/SayHello application/grpc
info: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.EndpointMiddleware[0]
      Executing endpoint 'gRPC - /Greet.Greeter/SayHello'
dbug: Grpc.AspNetCore.Server.ServerCallHandler[1]
      Reading message.
info: GrpcService.GreeterService[0]
      Hello World
dbug: Grpc.AspNetCore.Server.ServerCallHandler[6]
      Sending message.
info: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.EndpointMiddleware[1]
      Executed endpoint 'gRPC - /Greet.Greeter/SayHello'
info: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.Diagnostics[2]
      Request finished in 1.4113ms 200 application/grpc
```

- **Access Server-Side Logs:**
  - Server-side logs can be accessed depending on the app's environment. For console apps, the console logger should be enabled by default. For other environments like Docker, Kubernetes, or Windows Service, refer to the ASP.NET Core logging documentation.

- **gRPC Client Logging:**
  - To get logs from the .NET client, set the `GrpcChannelOptions.LoggerFactory` property when the client's channel is created. Alternatively, use the gRPC client factory to create the client.

```csharp name=net-client-dependency-injection.cs
var channel = GrpcChannel.ForAddress("https://localhost:5001", new GrpcChannelOptions
{
    LoggerFactory = LoggerFactory.Create(builder => builder.AddConsole())
});
var client = new Greeter.GreeterClient(channel);
```

- **Sample Client Logging Output:**
  - Example of console output at the `Debug` level of a gRPC client:

```console
dbug: Grpc.Net.Client.Internal.GrpcCall[1]
      Starting gRPC call. Method type: 'Unary', URI: 'https://localhost:5001/Greet.Greeter/SayHello'.
dbug: Grpc.Net.Client.Internal.GrpcCall[6]
      Sending message.
dbug: Grpc.Net.Client.Internal.GrpcCall[1]
      Reading message.
dbug: Grpc.Net.Client.Internal.GrpcCall[4]
      Finished gRPC call.
```

#### 2. Tracing

##### Overview:
gRPC services and the gRPC client provide information about gRPC calls using `DiagnosticSource` and `Activity`. Tracing events are written to the diagnostic source at the start and stop of the gRPC call activity.

##### Key Points:
- **gRPC Service Tracing:**
  - gRPC services are hosted on ASP.NET Core, which reports events about incoming HTTP requests. gRPC-specific metadata is added to the existing HTTP request diagnostics.

- **gRPC Client Tracing:**
  - The .NET gRPC client uses `HttpClient` to make gRPC calls and provides a custom diagnostic source, activity, and events.

- **Collecting Tracing:**
  - The easiest way to use `DiagnosticSource` is to configure a telemetry library such as Application Insights or OpenTelemetry. Tracing can be viewed in a managed service or run as your own distributed tracing system.

#### 3. Metrics

##### Overview:
Metrics represent data measures over intervals of time, such as requests per second. Metrics data allows observation of the state of an app at a high level.

##### Key Points:
- **gRPC Service Metrics:**
  - gRPC server metrics are reported on the `Grpc.AspNetCore.Server` event source.

| Name                      | Description                   |
| --------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `total-calls`             | Total Calls                   |
| `current-calls`           | Current Calls                 |
| `calls-failed`            | Total Calls Failed            |
| `calls-deadline-exceeded` | Total Calls Deadline Exceeded |
| `messages-sent`           | Total Messages Sent           |
| `messages-received`       | Total Messages Received       |
| `calls-unimplemented`     | Total Calls Unimplemented     |

- **gRPC Client Metrics:**
  - gRPC client metrics are reported on the `Grpc.Net.Client` event source.

| Name                      | Description                   |
| --------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `total-calls`             | Total Calls                   |
| `current-calls`           | Current Calls                 |
| `calls-failed`            | Total Calls Failed            |
| `calls-deadline-exceeded` | Total Calls Deadline Exceeded |
| `messages-sent`           | Total Messages Sent           |
| `messages-received`       | Total Messages Received       |

- **Observe Metrics:**
  - Use `dotnet-counters` for ad-hoc health monitoring and first-level performance investigation. Another way to observe gRPC metrics is to capture counter data using Application Insights.

```console
> dotnet-counters monitor --process-id 1902 Grpc.AspNetCore.Server

Press p to pause, r to resume, q to quit.
    Status: Running
[Grpc.AspNetCore.Server]
    Total Calls                                 300
    Current Calls                               5
    Total Calls Failed                          0
    Total Calls Deadline Exceeded               0
    Total Messages Sent                         295
    Total Messages Received                     300
    Total Calls Unimplemented                   0
```

```csharp name=Startup.cs
using Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Extensibility.EventCounterCollector;

public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    //... other code...

    services.ConfigureTelemetryModule<EventCounterCollectionModule>(
        (module, o) =>
        {
            module.Counters.Add(new EventCounterCollectionRequest("Grpc.AspNetCore.Server", "current-calls"));
            module.Counters.Add(new EventCounterCollectionRequest("Grpc.AspNetCore.Server", "total-calls"));
            module.Counters.Add(new EventCounterCollectionRequest("Grpc.AspNetCore.Server", "calls-failed"));
        }
    );
}
```

### Summary:

- **Logging:** Configure logging for gRPC services and clients to gather detailed diagnostics. Use the `Debug` level for detailed logs and access logs based on the app's environment.
- **Tracing:** Use `DiagnosticSource` and `Activity` to trace gRPC calls. Configure telemetry libraries like Application Insights or OpenTelemetry to collect and view tracing data.
- **Metrics:** Monitor gRPC service and client metrics using `dotnet-counters` or capture counter data using Application Insights for performance investigation and health monitoring.
