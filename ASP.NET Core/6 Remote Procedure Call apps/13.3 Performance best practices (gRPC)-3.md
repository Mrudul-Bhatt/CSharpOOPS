### Performance Best Practices with gRPC (Continued)

#### 9. Dispose Streaming Calls

##### Overview:
Always dispose streaming calls once they are no longer needed. This ensures that resources are properly cleaned up and prevents potential memory leaks.

##### Key Points:
- **Disposing Calls:**
  - The type returned when starting streaming calls implements `IDisposable`. Disposing a call ensures that it is properly cleaned up.
  
- **Using Statement:**
  - Use the `using` statement to automatically dispose of streaming calls.

```csharp name=dispose-streaming-call.cs
using var call = client.StreamingCall();
// Use the streaming call
```

- **Graceful Completion:**
  - Ideally, streaming calls should be completed gracefully before they are disposed. Disposing a call after graceful completion does not have any negative impact.

#### 10. Replace Unary Calls with Streaming

##### Overview:
gRPC bidirectional streaming can be used to replace unary gRPC calls in high-performance scenarios. Streaming allows for faster communication once the stream is established.

##### Key Points:
- **Advantages:**
  - Streaming messages back and forth is faster than sending a separate unary call for each message.

- **Example Service:**
```csharp name=streaming-service.cs
public override async Task SayHello(IAsyncStreamReader<HelloRequest> requestStream,
    IServerStreamWriter<HelloReply> responseStream, ServerCallContext context)
{
    await foreach (var request in requestStream.ReadAllAsync())
    {
        var helloReply = new HelloReply { Message = "Hello " + request.Name };
        await responseStream.WriteAsync(helloReply);
    }
}
```

- **Example Client:**
```csharp name=streaming-client.cs
var client = new Greet.GreeterClient(channel);
using var call = client.SayHello();

Console.WriteLine("Type a name then press enter.");
while (true)
{
    var text = Console.ReadLine();
    await call.RequestStream.WriteAsync(new HelloRequest { Name = text });
    await call.ResponseStream.MoveNext();
    Console.WriteLine($"Greeting: {call.ResponseStream.Current.Message}");
}
```

- **Considerations:**
  - Streaming calls can be interrupted by service or connection errors, requiring logic to restart the stream.
  - `RequestStream.WriteAsync` is not safe for multi-threading; only one message can be written at a time.
  - Streaming methods are limited to receiving and sending one type of message.

#### 11. Binary Payloads

##### Overview:
Binary payloads are supported in Protobuf with the `bytes` scalar value type. Protobuf efficiently serializes large binary payloads with minimal overhead.

##### Key Points:
- **Sending Binary Payloads:**
  - Use `UnsafeByteOperations.UnsafeWrap(ReadOnlyMemory<byte> bytes)` to create `ByteString` instances without additional allocations.

```csharp name=send-binary-payload.cs
var data = await File.ReadAllBytesAsync(path);
var payload = new PayloadResponse { Data = UnsafeByteOperations.UnsafeWrap(data) };
```

- **Reading Binary Payloads:**
  - Use `ByteString.Memory` and `ByteString.Span` properties to read data directly from `ByteString`.

```csharp name=read-binary-payload.cs
var byteString = UnsafeByteOperations.UnsafeWrap(new byte[] { 0, 1, 2 });
var data = byteString.Span;

for (var i = 0; i < data.Length; i++)
{
    Console.WriteLine(data[i]);
}
```

- **Large Binary Payloads:**
  - Avoid large binary payloads in gRPC messages. Consider splitting large payloads using gRPC streaming or using Web APIs for large binary data.

```csharp name=large-binary-payload.cs
builder.WebHost.ConfigureKestrel(options =>
{
    var http2 = options.Limits.Http2;
    http2.InitialConnectionWindowSize = 1024 * 1024 * 2; // 2 MB
    http2.InitialStreamWindowSize = 1024 * 1024; // 1 MB
});
```

### Summary:

- **Dispose Streaming Calls:** Always dispose streaming calls once they are no longer needed to ensure proper resource cleanup.
- **Replace Unary Calls with Streaming:** Use bidirectional streaming for high-performance scenarios to reduce latency and improve throughput.
- **Binary Payloads:** Efficiently handle binary payloads in Protobuf, avoid large payloads, and consider using gRPC streaming or Web APIs for large data transfers.
