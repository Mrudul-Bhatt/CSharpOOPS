### Overview for gRPC on .NET

The article "Overview for gRPC on .NET" on Microsoft Docs for ASP.NET Core provides detailed information on using gRPC with .NET. Here are the key points explained:

#### 1. C# Tooling Support for `.proto` Files

##### Overview:
gRPC uses a contract-first approach to API development, where services and messages are defined in `.proto` files. .NET provides tooling support to automatically generate types from these files.

##### Key Points:
- **Define Services and Messages:**
  - Services and messages are defined in `.proto` files using the Protocol Buffers language.
  - Example `.proto` file:

```protobuf name=greet.proto
syntax = "proto3";

service Greeter {
  rpc SayHello (HelloRequest) returns (HelloReply);
}

message HelloRequest {
  string name = 1;
}

message HelloReply {
  string message = 1;
}
```

- **Generate .NET Types:**
  - Add a package reference to the [Grpc.Tools](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Grpc.Tools/) package.
  - Include `.proto` files in the `<Protobuf>` item group in the project file.
  - Example project file configuration:

```xml name=ProjectFile.csproj
<ItemGroup>
  <Protobuf Include="Protos\greet.proto" />
</ItemGroup>
```

- **Generated Types:**
  - The `Grpc.Tools` package generates .NET types for services, clients, and messages based on the `.proto` definitions.
  - These generated types can be used to implement and call gRPC services.

#### 2. gRPC Services on ASP.NET Core

##### Overview:
gRPC services can be hosted on ASP.NET Core, providing full integration with ASP.NET Core features such as logging, dependency injection (DI), authentication, and authorization.

##### Key Points:
- **Add gRPC Services:**
  - Add the [Grpc.AspNetCore](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Grpc.AspNetCore) package to the project.
  - Configure gRPC in the `Program.cs` file.
  - Example configuration:

```csharp name=Program.cs
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.Services.AddGrpc();
var app = builder.Build();
app.MapGrpcService<GreeterService>();
app.Run();
```

- **gRPC Service Project Template:**
  - The **ASP.NET Core gRPC Service** project template provides a starter service.
  - Example service implementation:

```csharp name=GreeterService.cs
public class GreeterService : Greeter.GreeterBase
{
    private readonly ILogger<GreeterService> _logger;

    public GreeterService(ILogger<GreeterService> logger)
    {
        _logger = logger;
    }

    public override Task<HelloReply> SayHello(HelloRequest request, ServerCallContext context)
    {
        _logger.LogInformation("Saying hello to {Name}", request.Name);
        return Task.FromResult(new HelloReply 
        {
            Message = "Hello " + request.Name
        });
    }
}
```

- **Register the Service:**
  - The service is made accessible to clients in `Program.cs` using `MapGrpcService`.
  - Example registration:

```csharp name=Program.cs
app.MapGrpcService<GreeterService>();
```

#### 3. Call gRPC Services with a .NET Client

##### Overview:
gRPC clients are concrete client types generated from `.proto` files. These clients provide methods that translate to the gRPC service methods defined in the `.proto` files.

##### Key Points:
- **Create a gRPC Client:**
  - A gRPC client is created using a channel, which represents a long-lived connection to a gRPC service.
  - Example client creation and call:

```csharp name=CallGrpcService.cs
var channel = GrpcChannel.ForAddress("https://localhost:5001");
var client = new Greeter.GreeterClient(channel);

var response = await client.SayHelloAsync(new HelloRequest { Name = "World" });

Console.WriteLine(response.Message);
```

- **Using the Client:**
  - The `GreeterClient` type is generated from the `Greeter` service definition in the `.proto` file.
  - The client methods (`SayHelloAsync`) correspond to the service methods defined in the `.proto` file.

### Summary:

- **C# Tooling Support for `.proto` Files:** Define services and messages in `.proto` files, and use the `Grpc.Tools` package to generate .NET types for services, clients, and messages.
- **gRPC Services on ASP.NET Core:** Host gRPC services on ASP.NET Core, leveraging its features such as logging, DI, and authentication. Configure gRPC in `Program.cs` and use the gRPC service project template.
- **Call gRPC Services with a .NET Client:** Create gRPC clients using channels and call service methods. The client types and methods are generated from the `.proto` files.
