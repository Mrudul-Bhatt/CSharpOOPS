Sure! Let's delve into the remaining three points of the article "Use hubs in SignalR for ASP.NET Core" on Microsoft Docs for ASP.NET Core:

### 1. Inject Services into a Hub

#### Overview:
ASP.NET Core SignalR allows you to inject services into your hub using dependency injection (DI). This enables your hub to use services registered in the application's service container, such as logging, data access, and other custom services.

#### Key Points:
- **Dependency Injection:** Services can be injected into the hub's constructor.
- **Service Registration:** Ensure that the services are registered in the application's service container.

#### Example:

```csharp name=Services/IMessageService.cs
public interface IMessageService
{
    Task SendMessageAsync(string user, string message);
}
```

```csharp name=Services/MessageService.cs
public class MessageService : IMessageService
{
    public Task SendMessageAsync(string user, string message)
    {
        // Implement the logic to send a message
        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}
```

```csharp name=Hubs/ChatHub.cs
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class ChatHub : Hub
{
    private readonly IMessageService _messageService;

    public ChatHub(IMessageService messageService)
    {
        _messageService = messageService;
    }

    public async Task SendMessage(string user, string message)
    {
        await _messageService.SendMessageAsync(user, message);
        await Clients.All.SendAsync("ReceiveMessage", user, message);
    }
}
```

```csharp name=Program.cs
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Add services to the container.
builder.Services.AddRazorPages();
builder.Services.AddSignalR();
builder.Services.AddSingleton<IMessageService, MessageService>();

var app = builder.Build();

// Configure the HTTP request pipeline.
if (!app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
{
    app.UseExceptionHandler("/Error");
    app.UseHsts();
}

app.UseHttpsRedirection();
app.UseStaticFiles();

app.UseRouting();

app.UseAuthorization();

app.MapRazorPages();
app.MapHub<ChatHub>("/chathub");

app.Run();
```

In this example:
- The `IMessageService` interface and `MessageService` implementation are defined.
- The `MessageService` is registered in the service container.
- The `ChatHub` class injects the `IMessageService` through its constructor.

### 2. Handle Events for a Connection

#### Overview:
SignalR provides several events that allow you to handle connection lifecycle events such as when a client connects or disconnects. These events can be used to manage resources, log activity, or perform other actions when connections change state.

#### Key Points:
- **OnConnectedAsync:** Override this method to handle logic when a client connects.
- **OnDisconnectedAsync:** Override this method to handle logic when a client disconnects.
- **Context Object:** Use the `Context` object to access connection-specific information.

#### Example:

```csharp name=Hubs/ChatHub.cs
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class ChatHub : Hub
{
    public override async Task OnConnectedAsync()
    {
        string connectionId = Context.ConnectionId;
        await Clients.All.SendAsync("ReceiveMessage", "System", $"{connectionId} joined the chat.");
        await base.OnConnectedAsync();
    }

    public override async Task OnDisconnectedAsync(Exception exception)
    {
        string connectionId = Context.ConnectionId;
        await Clients.All.SendAsync("ReceiveMessage", "System", $"{connectionId} left the chat.");
        await base.OnDisconnectedAsync(exception);
    }

    public async Task SendMessage(string user, string message)
    {
        await Clients.All.SendAsync("ReceiveMessage", user, message);
    }
}
```

In this example:
- The `OnConnectedAsync` method sends a message to all clients when a new client connects.
- The `OnDisconnectedAsync` method sends a message to all clients when a client disconnects.

### 3. Handle Errors

#### Overview:
Handling errors in SignalR hubs is crucial for ensuring robust and reliable real-time communication. You can handle errors by overriding the `OnDisconnectedAsync` method, implementing try-catch blocks in hub methods, and using logging to capture and diagnose issues.

#### Key Points:
- **Try-Catch Blocks:** Use try-catch blocks in hub methods to handle exceptions.
- **OnDisconnectedAsync:** Override this method to handle disconnection errors and perform cleanup.
- **Logging:** Use logging to capture and diagnose errors.

#### Example:

```csharp name=Hubs/ChatHub.cs
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class ChatHub : Hub
{
    private readonly ILogger<ChatHub> _logger;

    public ChatHub(ILogger<ChatHub> logger)
    {
        _logger = logger;
    }

    public override async Task OnDisconnectedAsync(Exception exception)
    {
        if (exception != null)
        {
            _logger.LogError(exception, "An error occurred during disconnection.");
        }

        string connectionId = Context.ConnectionId;
        await Clients.All.SendAsync("ReceiveMessage", "System", $"{connectionId} left the chat.");
        await base.OnDisconnectedAsync(exception);
    }

    public async Task SendMessage(string user, string message)
    {
        try
        {
            await Clients.All.SendAsync("ReceiveMessage", user, message);
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            _logger.LogError(ex, "An error occurred while sending a message.");
            throw;
        }
    }
}
```

```csharp name=Program.cs
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Add services to the container.
builder.Services.AddRazorPages();
builder.Services.AddSignalR();
builder.Services.AddLogging();

var app = builder.Build();

// Configure the HTTP request pipeline.
if (!app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
{
    app.UseExceptionHandler("/Error");
    app.UseHsts();
}

app.UseHttpsRedirection();
app.UseStaticFiles();

app.UseRouting();

app.UseAuthorization();

app.MapRazorPages();
app.MapHub<ChatHub>("/chathub");

app.Run();
```

In this example:
- The `ILogger<ChatHub>` service is injected into the `ChatHub` class to enable logging.
- Errors are handled in the `SendMessage` method using a try-catch block, and exceptions are logged.
- The `OnDisconnectedAsync` method logs any exceptions that occur during disconnection.

### Summary:

- **Inject Services into a Hub:** Use dependency injection to inject services into your hub, enabling the use of registered services such as logging, data access, and custom services.
- **Handle Events for a Connection:** Override the `OnConnectedAsync` and `OnDisconnectedAsync` methods to handle connection lifecycle events such as client connections and disconnections.
- **Handle Errors:** Use try-catch blocks in hub methods, override the `OnDisconnectedAsync` method, and use logging to handle and diagnose errors in SignalR hubs.
