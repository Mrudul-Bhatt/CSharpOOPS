Sure! Let's delve into the remaining points of the article "ASP.NET Core SignalR JavaScript client" on Microsoft Docs for ASP.NET Core:

### 5. Error Handling and Logging

#### Overview:
Handling errors and logging are important aspects of building robust applications. SignalR provides mechanisms to handle errors and log information both on the client and server sides.

#### Key Points:
- **Error Handling:** Use try-catch blocks and Promise `.catch` methods to handle exceptions when calling hub methods from the client.
- **Logging:** Use the logging configuration in `HubConnectionBuilder` to log information and errors.
- **HubConnection Events:** Handle events like `closed`, `reconnecting`, and `reconnected` to log information about connection state changes.

#### Example:

```javascript name=signalr-client.js
const connection = new signalR.HubConnectionBuilder()
    .withUrl("/chatHub")
    .configureLogging(signalR.LogLevel.Information)
    .build();

connection.on("ReceiveMessage", (user, message) => {
    console.log(`${user}: ${message}`);
});

connection.start()
    .then(() => console.log("Connection started"))
    .catch(err => console.error("Error while starting connection: " + err));

connection.onclose(err => {
    console.error("Connection closed due to error: " + err);
});

connection.onreconnecting(err => {
    console.warn("Connection lost due to error. Reconnecting...", err);
});

connection.onreconnected(connectionId => {
    console.log("Connection reestablished. Connected with connectionId", connectionId);
});
```

In this example:
- Logging is configured to log information at the `Information` level.
- Error handling is performed using `.catch` and event handlers for `onclose`, `onreconnecting`, and `onreconnected` events.

### 6. Reconnect Clients

#### Overview:
Handling reconnections is important to ensure that your application can recover and re-establish the connection to the SignalR hub. SignalR provides built-in mechanisms to handle reconnections.

#### Key Points:
- **Automatic Reconnect:** Enable automatic reconnect using the `withAutomaticReconnect` method.
- **Reconnect Intervals:** Configure custom reconnect intervals if needed.
- **HubConnection Events:** Handle `reconnecting`, `reconnected`, and `closed` events to manage reconnections.

#### Example:

```javascript name=signalr-client.js
const connection = new signalR.HubConnectionBuilder()
    .withUrl("/chatHub")
    .withAutomaticReconnect()
    .configureLogging(signalR.LogLevel.Information)
    .build();

connection.on("ReceiveMessage", (user, message) => {
    console.log(`${user}: ${message}`);
});

connection.start()
    .then(() => console.log("Connection started"))
    .catch(err => console.error("Error while starting connection: " + err));

connection.onreconnecting(err => {
    console.warn("Connection lost due to error. Reconnecting...", err);
});

connection.onreconnected(connectionId => {
    console.log("Connection reestablished. Connected with connectionId", connectionId);
});

connection.onclose(err => {
    console.error("Connection closed due to error: " + err);
});
```

In this example:
- Automatic reconnect is enabled using `withAutomaticReconnect`.
- Custom reconnect intervals can be configured by passing an array of millisecond values to `withAutomaticReconnect`.
- Events for `reconnecting`, `reconnected`, and `onclose` are handled to manage reconnections.

### 7. Browser Sleeping Tab

#### Overview:
When a browser tab goes to sleep (e.g., when minimized or when the system is in a low power state), SignalR connections may be affected. Handling these cases ensures that the client can recover from such interruptions.

#### Key Points:
- **Visibility API:** Use the Visibility API to detect when the tab becomes visible again.
- **Re-establish Connection:** Re-establish the SignalR connection when the tab becomes visible.
- **Event Listeners:** Add event listeners for `visibilitychange` events.

#### Example:

```javascript name=signalr-client.js
const connection = new signalR.HubConnectionBuilder()
    .withUrl("/chatHub")
    .withAutomaticReconnect()
    .configureLogging(signalR.LogLevel.Information)
    .build();

connection.on("ReceiveMessage", (user, message) => {
    console.log(`${user}: ${message}`);
});

connection.start()
    .then(() => console.log("Connection started"))
    .catch(err => console.error("Error while starting connection: " + err));

connection.onreconnecting(err => {
    console.warn("Connection lost due to error. Reconnecting...", err);
});

connection.onreconnected(connectionId => {
    console.log("Connection reestablished. Connected with connectionId", connectionId);
});

connection.onclose(err => {
    console.error("Connection closed due to error: " + err);
});

document.addEventListener("visibilitychange", async () => {
    if (document.visibilityState === "visible" && connection.state === signalR.HubConnectionState.Disconnected) {
        try {
            await connection.start();
            console.log("Connection restarted after tab became visible.");
        } catch (err) {
            console.error("Error while restarting connection: " + err);
        }
    }
});
```

In this example:
- The Visibility API is used to detect when the tab becomes visible.
- The SignalR connection is re-established when the tab becomes visible and the connection is disconnected.

### Summary:

- **Error Handling and Logging:** Use try-catch blocks, Promise `.catch` methods, and logging configurations to handle errors and log information.
- **Reconnect Clients:** Enable automatic reconnect using `withAutomaticReconnect` and handle reconnection events.
- **Browser Sleeping Tab:** Use the Visibility API to detect when the tab becomes visible and re-establish the SignalR connection if needed.
