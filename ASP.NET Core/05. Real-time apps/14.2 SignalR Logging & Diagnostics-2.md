### Step 1: Understand the Remaining Points in the Article

I have reviewed the remaining points in the article "Logging and diagnostics in ASP.NET Core SignalR" on Microsoft Docs for ASP.NET Core. Below is a summary of the remaining points mentioned in the article.

### Step 2: Summarize Retrieved Content

#### 1. Collect a Network Trace with Fiddler (Preferred Option)

##### Overview:
Fiddler is a powerful tool for collecting HTTP traces. It works for all applications and can capture detailed network activity.

##### Key Points:
- **Installation:** Install Fiddler from [telerik.com/fiddler](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler).
- **Running Fiddler:**
  - Launch Fiddler.
  - Run your application and reproduce the issue.
- **HTTPS Traffic:**
  - If connecting using HTTPS, additional steps are required to decrypt HTTPS traffic. Refer to the [Fiddler documentation](https://docs.telerik.com/fiddler/Configure-Fiddler/Tasks/DecryptHTTPS).
- **Exporting the Trace:**
  - Choose **File > Save > All Sessions** from the menu bar to export the trace.
- **Example Screenshot:**

#### 2. Collect a Network Trace with tcpdump (macOS and Linux Only)

##### Overview:
`tcpdump` is a command-line tool for collecting raw TCP traces. It works on macOS and Linux.

##### Key Points:
- **Running tcpdump:**
  - Open a command shell.
  - Run the following command to collect raw TCP traces:
    ```console
    tcpdump -i [interface] -w trace.pcap
    ```
  - Replace `[interface]` with the appropriate network interface (e.g., `/dev/eth0` for Ethernet or `/dev/lo0` for localhost traffic).
- **Permissions:**
  - You may need to be `root` or prefix the command with `sudo` if you encounter a permissions error.

#### 3. Collect a Network Trace in the Browser

##### Overview:
Most browser developer tools have a "Network" tab that allows capturing network activity between the browser and the server. However, these traces may not include WebSocket and Server-Sent Events (SSE) data.

##### Key Points:
- **Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer:**
  - Press F12 to open the Dev Tools.
  - Click the Network Tab.
  - Refresh the page and reproduce the problem.
  - Click the Save icon in the toolbar to export the trace as a "HAR" file.
  - ![The Save Icon on the Microsoft Edge Dev Tools Network Tab](diagnostics/ie-edge-har-export.png)
- **Google Chrome:**
  - Press F12 to open the Dev Tools.
  - Click the Network Tab.
  - Refresh the page and reproduce the problem.
  - Right-click anywhere in the list of requests and choose "Save as HAR with content".
  - !["Save as HAR with Content" option in Google Chrome Dev Tools Network Tab](diagnostics/chrome-har-export.png)
- **Mozilla Firefox:**
  - Press F12 to open the Dev Tools.
  - Click the Network Tab.
  - Refresh the page and reproduce the problem.
  - Right-click anywhere in the list of requests and choose "Save All As HAR".
  - !["Save All As HAR" option in Mozilla Firefox Dev Tools Network Tab](diagnostics/firefox-har-export.png)

#### 4. Attach Diagnostics Files to GitHub Issues

##### Overview:
Attaching diagnostics files to GitHub issues can help in troubleshooting. It is recommended to attach files rather than pasting their content directly into the issue.

##### Key Points:
- **Attaching Files:**
  - Rename the diagnostics files to have a `.txt` extension.
  - Drag and drop the files onto the GitHub issue.
- **Example Screenshot:**
  - ![Dragging log files onto a GitHub issue](diagnostics/attaching-diagnostics-files.png)
- **Note:**
  - Do not paste the content of log files or network traces directly into the issue. These logs and traces can be large, and GitHub usually truncates them.

#### 5. Metrics

##### Overview:
Metrics provide data measures over intervals of time, allowing observation of the state of an application at a high level. SignalR server metrics are reported on the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Connections` event source.

##### Key Points:
- **SignalR Server Metrics:**
  - `connections-started`: Total connections started.
  - `connections-stopped`: Total connections stopped.
  - `connections-timed-out`: Total connections timed out.
  - `current-connections`: Current connections.
  - `connections-duration`: Average connection duration.
- **Monitoring Metrics:**
  - Use `dotnet-counters` to monitor a .NET application.
  - Example Command:
    ```console
    dotnet-counters monitor --process-id 37016 Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Connections
    ```
  - Example Output:
    ```console
    Press p to pause, r to resume, q to quit.
        Status: Running
    [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Connections]
        Average Connection Duration (ms)       16,040.56
        Current Connections                         1
        Total Connections Started                   8
        Total Connections Stopped                   7
        Total Connections Timed Out                 0
    ```

### Summary:

- **Collect a Network Trace with Fiddler:** Install Fiddler, run your app, reproduce the issue, and export the trace.
- **Collect a Network Trace with tcpdump:** Run `tcpdump` to collect raw TCP traces on macOS and Linux.
- **Collect a Network Trace in the Browser:** Use browser developer tools to capture network activity and export the trace as a "HAR" file.
- **Attach Diagnostics Files to GitHub Issues:** Rename diagnostics files to `.txt` and attach them to the GitHub issue.
- **Metrics:** Monitor SignalR server metrics using `dotnet-counters` and observe metrics like connection duration and total connections.
