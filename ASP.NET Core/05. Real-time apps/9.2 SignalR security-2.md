### Step 1: Understand the Structure of the Article

I have reviewed the remaining sections of the article "Security considerations in ASP.NET Core SignalR" on Microsoft Docs for ASP.NET Core. Below is a summary of the three points mentioned in the article.

### Step 2: Summarize the Identified Sections

#### 1. Access Token Logging

##### Overview:
Access token logging involves logging information about access tokens used in SignalR connections. Logging access tokens can be a security risk because tokens can be used by attackers to impersonate users and gain unauthorized access to the SignalR hubs.

##### Key Points:
- **Avoid Logging Tokens:** Ensure that access tokens are not logged in application logs.
- **Sensitive Information:** Access tokens contain sensitive information that should not be exposed.
- **Configuration:** Configure the logging system to exclude access tokens from logs.

##### Example:

```csharp name=Program.cs
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;

public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        CreateHostBuilder(args).Build().Run();
    }

    public static IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder(string[] args) =>
        Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
            .ConfigureWebHostDefaults(webBuilder =>
            {
                webBuilder.UseStartup<Startup>();
            })
            .ConfigureLogging(logging =>
            {
                logging.AddFilter("Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR", LogLevel.Warning);
            });
}
```

In this example:
- The logging system is configured to exclude detailed logs from the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR` namespace by setting the log level to `Warning`.

#### 2. Exceptions

##### Overview:
Handling and logging exceptions in SignalR is crucial for maintaining the security and stability of the application. Proper exception handling ensures that sensitive information is not exposed to the clients and helps in diagnosing issues.

##### Key Points:
- **Catch Exceptions:** Catch exceptions in hub methods to prevent unhandled exceptions.
- **Log Exceptions:** Log exceptions to help diagnose issues without exposing sensitive information.
- **Custom Error Messages:** Send custom error messages to clients instead of detailed exception information.

##### Example:

```csharp name=ChatHub.cs
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class ChatHub : Hub
{
    private readonly ILogger<ChatHub> _logger;

    public ChatHub(ILogger<ChatHub> logger)
    {
        _logger = logger;
    }

    public async Task SendMessage(string user, string message)
    {
        try
        {
            await Clients.All.SendAsync("ReceiveMessage", user, message);
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            _logger.LogError(ex, "Error in SendMessage");
            throw new HubException("An error occurred while sending the message.");
        }
    }
}
```

In this example:
- Exceptions in the `SendMessage` method are caught and logged.
- A custom error message is sent to the clients using `HubException`.

#### 3. Buffer Management

##### Overview:
Buffer management involves managing the memory buffers used by SignalR to handle incoming and outgoing messages. Proper buffer management is essential to prevent memory exhaustion and ensure the performance and reliability of the SignalR application.

##### Key Points:
- **Buffer Size Limits:** Configure buffer size limits to control the maximum size of messages.
- **Memory Usage:** Monitor and manage memory usage to prevent memory exhaustion.
- **Configuration:** Configure SignalR options to set buffer size limits.

##### Example:

```csharp name=Startup.cs
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR;

public class Startup
{
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        services.AddSignalR(options =>
        {
            options.MaximumReceiveMessageSize = 32 * 1024; // 32 KB
            options.StreamBufferCapacity = 10;
        });
        // Add other services
    }

    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
    {
        app.UseRouting();

        app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
        {
            endpoints.MapHub<ChatHub>("/chathub");
            // Map other endpoints
        });
    }
}
```

In this example:
- The `MaximumReceiveMessageSize` option is set to limit the size of incoming messages to 32 KB.
- The `StreamBufferCapacity` option is set to limit the buffer capacity for streaming to 10.

### Summary:

- **Access Token Logging:** Avoid logging access tokens to prevent exposure of sensitive information. Configure the logging system to exclude access tokens from logs.
- **Exceptions:** Catch exceptions in hub methods to prevent unhandled exceptions. Log exceptions to help diagnose issues without exposing sensitive information to clients. Use custom error messages to inform clients about errors.
- **Buffer Management:** Manage memory buffers used by SignalR to handle messages. Configure buffer size limits to control memory usage and prevent memory exhaustion.
