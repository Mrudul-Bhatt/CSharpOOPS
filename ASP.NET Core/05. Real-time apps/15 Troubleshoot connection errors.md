I wasn't able to retrieve the file directly. However, I can summarize the key points based on my training data. Let's break down the article "Troubleshoot connection errors" in ASP.NET Core SignalR as mentioned on Microsoft Docs.

### Troubleshoot Connection Errors in ASP.NET Core SignalR

#### 1. Common Errors

##### Overview:
There are several common errors that can occur when using ASP.NET Core SignalR. Each error has specific troubleshooting steps to help identify and resolve the issue.

##### Key Points:
- **Error: "WebSocket connection to 'ws://...' failed":**
  - **Cause:** This error indicates that the WebSocket connection failed to establish.
  - **Troubleshooting:**
    - Ensure the server is correctly configured to accept WebSocket connections.
    - Check for any firewall or proxy settings that might be blocking WebSocket connections.
    - Verify that the WebSocket URL is correct and matches the server's configuration.

- **Error: "Failed to complete negotiation with the server":**
  - **Cause:** This error occurs during the negotiation phase between the client and the server.
  - **Troubleshooting:**
    - Confirm that the server is running and accessible.
    - Ensure that the server endpoint is correctly defined in the client configuration.
    - Check server logs for any errors during the negotiation process.

- **Error: "Cannot send data if the connection is not in the 'Connected' state":**
  - **Cause:** This error indicates that the client attempted to send data before the connection was fully established.
  - **Troubleshooting:**
    - Make sure that the client waits for the connection to be fully established before attempting to send data.
    - Use connection event handlers to determine when the connection is ready.

#### 2. Diagnosing Connection Issues

##### Overview:
Diagnosing connection issues involves gathering detailed logs and network traces to identify the root cause of the problem.

##### Key Points:
- **Enable Detailed Logs:**
  - Configure logging levels to capture detailed information about the connection process.
  - Example configuration in `appsettings.json`:

```json name=appsettings.json
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR": "Debug",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Connections": "Debug"
    }
  }
}
```

- **Collect Network Traces:**
  - Use tools like Fiddler, tcpdump, or browser developer tools to capture network activity and identify issues with the connection process.

#### 3. Handling Connection Lifecycle Events

##### Overview:
Understanding and handling connection lifecycle events can help manage connection stability and provide a better user experience.

##### Key Points:
- **Connection Events:**
  - **Connected:** Triggered when the connection is successfully established.
  - **Disconnected:** Triggered when the connection is lost.
  - **Reconnecting:** Triggered when the client is attempting to reconnect after a disconnection.
- **Example Handlers:**

```javascript name=signalr-client.js
const connection = new signalR.HubConnectionBuilder()
    .withUrl("/chathub")
    .build();

connection.onclose(async () => {
    console.log("Connection closed. Attempting to reconnect...");
    await start();
});

connection.onreconnecting(error => {
    console.log("Reconnecting due to error:", error);
});

connection.onreconnected(connectionId => {
    console.log("Reconnected. Connection ID:", connectionId);
});

async function start() {
    try {
        await connection.start();
        console.log("Connected.");
    } catch (err) {
        console.log("Error connecting:", err);
        setTimeout(start, 5000);
    }
}

start();
```

#### 4. Network Configuration and Firewalls

##### Overview:
Network configuration and firewalls can impact the ability to establish and maintain connections. Proper configuration is essential for stable connections.

##### Key Points:
- **Firewall Settings:**
  - Ensure that the necessary ports for WebSocket and other SignalR transports are open and not blocked by firewalls.
- **Proxy Configuration:**
  - Configure any proxies to allow WebSocket traffic and other necessary protocols.

#### 5. Additional Resources

##### Overview:
The article provides additional resources and links for further reading and troubleshooting.

##### Key Points:
- **Links to Documentation:**
  - Official SignalR documentation for detailed configuration and usage.
  - ASP.NET Core logging documentation for more information on configuring logging.
  - Tools and resources for network diagnostics and tracing.

### Summary:

- **Common Errors:** Identify and troubleshoot common connection errors such as WebSocket connection failures, negotiation issues, and data sending errors.
- **Diagnosing Connection Issues:** Enable detailed logs and collect network traces to diagnose connection issues.
- **Handling Connection Lifecycle Events:** Use connection event handlers to manage connection stability and provide a better user experience.
- **Network Configuration and Firewalls:** Ensure proper network configuration and firewall settings to allow SignalR traffic.
- **Additional Resources:** Refer to additional documentation and tools for further troubleshooting and diagnostics.
