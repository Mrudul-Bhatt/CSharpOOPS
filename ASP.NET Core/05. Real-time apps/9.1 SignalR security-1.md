### Step 1: Understand the Structure of the Article

I have reviewed the article "Security considerations in ASP.NET Core SignalR" on Microsoft Docs for ASP.NET Core. Below is a summary of the three points mentioned in the article.

### Step 2: Summarize the Identified Sections

#### 1. Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

##### Overview:
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a security feature implemented by web browsers to prevent web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the web page. When developing SignalR applications, configuring CORS is essential to control which domains can interact with your SignalR hubs.

##### Key Points:
- **CORS Middleware:** Use ASP.NET Core CORS middleware to configure CORS policies.
- **Allow Specific Origins:** Specify which origins are allowed to make requests to the SignalR hub.
- **Security Risks:** Allowing all origins can expose your application to security risks such as Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

##### Example:

```csharp name=Startup.cs
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;

public class Startup
{
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        services.AddCors(options =>
        {
            options.AddPolicy("CorsPolicy", builder =>
            {
                builder.WithOrigins("https://example.com")
                       .AllowAnyHeader()
                       .AllowAnyMethod()
                       .AllowCredentials();
            });
        });

        services.AddSignalR();
        // Add other services
    }

    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
    {
        app.UseRouting();

        app.UseCors("CorsPolicy");

        app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
        {
            endpoints.MapHub<ChatHub>("/chathub");
            // Map other endpoints
        });
    }
}
```

In this example:
- CORS middleware is configured with a policy that allows requests from "https://example.com".
- The CORS policy is applied to the SignalR hub endpoint.

#### 2. WebSocket Origin Restriction

##### Overview:
WebSocket origin restriction is a security measure that prevents unauthorized domains from initiating WebSocket connections to your SignalR server. This helps protect your application from attacks such as Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking.

##### Key Points:
- **Origin Check:** Implement an origin check to validate the origin of incoming WebSocket requests.
- **Restrict Origins:** Restrict WebSocket connections to trusted domains only.
- **Security Implications:** Failing to restrict origins can lead to unauthorized access to your SignalR hubs.

##### Example:

```csharp name=Startup.cs
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class Startup
{
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        services.AddSignalR();
        // Add other services
    }

    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
    {
        app.UseRouting();

        app.Use(async (context, next) =>
        {
            if (context.WebSockets.IsWebSocketRequest)
            {
                var origin = context.Request.Headers["Origin"];
                if (origin != "https://example.com")
                {
                    context.Response.StatusCode = StatusCodes.Status403Forbidden;
                    return;
                }
            }
            await next();
        });

        app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
        {
            endpoints.MapHub<ChatHub>("/chathub");
            // Map other endpoints
        });
    }
}
```

In this example:
- A middleware is added to check the origin of incoming WebSocket requests.
- WebSocket connections are restricted to "https://example.com".

#### 3. ConnectionId

##### Overview:
The ConnectionId is a unique identifier assigned to each connection in SignalR. It is used to identify and manage connections, allowing you to send messages to specific clients or groups of clients. Proper handling of ConnectionId is crucial for maintaining secure communication.

##### Key Points:
- **Unique Identifier:** Each connection has a unique ConnectionId.
- **Connection Management:** Use ConnectionId to manage connections, groups, and message delivery.
- **Security Considerations:** Do not expose ConnectionId to untrusted clients, as it can be used to impersonate connections.

##### Example:

```csharp name=ChatHub.cs
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class ChatHub : Hub
{
    public async Task SendMessage(string user, string message)
    {
        string connectionId = Context.ConnectionId;
        await Clients.Client(connectionId).SendAsync("ReceiveMessage", user, message);
    }

    public override async Task OnConnectedAsync()
    {
        string connectionId = Context.ConnectionId;
        // Add connectionId to a group, log it, or perform other actions
        await base.OnConnectedAsync();
    }

    public override async Task OnDisconnectedAsync(Exception exception)
    {
        string connectionId = Context.ConnectionId;
        // Remove connectionId from a group, log it, or perform other actions
        await base.OnDisconnectedAsync(exception);
    }
}
```

In this example:
- The `ConnectionId` is used to send messages to the specific client that initiated the request.
- The `ConnectionId` is also used in the `OnConnectedAsync` and `OnDisconnectedAsync` methods to manage connection state.

### Summary:

- **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS):** Configure CORS policies to control which domains can interact with your SignalR hubs. Use CORS middleware to specify allowed origins and enhance security.
- **WebSocket Origin Restriction:** Implement origin checks to validate the origin of incoming WebSocket requests. Restrict WebSocket connections to trusted domains to prevent unauthorized access.
- **ConnectionId:** Use the unique ConnectionId assigned to each connection to manage connections and message delivery securely. Avoid exposing ConnectionId to untrusted clients to prevent impersonation.
