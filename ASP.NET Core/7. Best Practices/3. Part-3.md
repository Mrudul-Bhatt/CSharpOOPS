### ASP.NET Core Best Practices

Continuing from the previous points, here are the next three key points explained:

#### 7. Pool HTTP Connections with HttpClientFactory

##### Overview:
Reusing `HttpClient` instances is crucial to avoid socket exhaustion and improve performance. The `HttpClientFactory` provides a way to manage the lifetime of `HttpClient` instances and ensure they are reused efficiently.

##### Key Points:
- **Avoid Creating and Disposing Directly:**
  - Do not create and dispose of `HttpClient` instances directly as it can lead to socket exhaustion.

- **Use HttpClientFactory:**
  - Use `HttpClientFactory` to manage `HttpClient` instances and ensure their reuse.

- **Benefits:**
  - Efficient use of connections.
  - Improved performance and reliability.
  - Simplified management of `HttpClient` lifetimes.

- **Implementation:**
  - Register `HttpClientFactory` in the `Startup.cs` file and use it to create `HttpClient` instances.

```csharp name=Startup.cs
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddHttpClient();
}
```

```csharp name=MyService.cs
public class MyService
{
    private readonly HttpClient _httpClient;

    public MyService(IHttpClientFactory httpClientFactory)
    {
        _httpClient = httpClientFactory.CreateClient();
    }

    // Use _httpClient to make HTTP requests
}
```

For more information, see [HttpClientFactory in ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/microservices-architecture/implement-resilient-applications/use-httpclientfactory-to-implement-resilient-http-requests).

#### 8. Keep Common Code Paths Fast

##### Overview:
Frequently-called code paths, such as middleware components and code executed for every request, should be optimized for performance to ensure the application runs efficiently under load.

##### Key Points:
- **Optimize Middleware Components:**
  - Optimize middleware components, especially those run early in the request processing pipeline, as they have a significant impact on performance.

- **Avoid Long-Running Tasks:**
  - Do not use custom middleware components with long-running tasks.

- **Use Profiling Tools:**
  - Use performance profiling tools, such as Visual Studio Diagnostic Tools or PerfView, to identify and optimize hot code paths.

- **Recommendations:**
  - Avoid complex logic and blocking operations in common code paths.
  - Ensure that code executed for every request is efficient and optimized.

For more information, see [Performance profiling tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/profiling/profiling-feature-tour) and [PerfView](https://github.com/Microsoft/perfview).

#### 9. Complete Long-Running Tasks Outside of HTTP Requests

##### Overview:
Long-running tasks should not be handled as part of ordinary HTTP request processing. Instead, consider using background services or other mechanisms to handle long-running operations.

##### Key Points:
- **Avoid Blocking HTTP Requests:**
  - Do not wait for long-running tasks to complete as part of HTTP request processing.

- **Use Background Services:**
  - Use background services, such as hosted services or Azure Functions, to handle long-running tasks.

- **Real-Time Communication:**
  - Use real-time communication options, such as SignalR, to communicate with clients asynchronously.

- **Implementation:**
  - Implement background tasks as hosted services in ASP.NET Core.

```csharp name=MyBackgroundService.cs
public class MyBackgroundService : BackgroundService
{
    protected override async Task ExecuteAsync(CancellationToken stoppingToken)
    {
        while (!stoppingToken.IsCancellationRequested)
        {
            // Perform long-running task here
            await Task.Delay(1000, stoppingToken);
        }
    }
}
```

```csharp name=Startup.cs
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddHostedService<MyBackgroundService>();
}
```

For more information, see [Background tasks with hosted services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/host/hosted-services) and [SignalR](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/signalr/introduction).

These best practices help in designing high-performance and scalable ASP.NET Core applications by efficiently managing HTTP connections, optimizing critical code paths, and handling long-running tasks outside of HTTP requests.
