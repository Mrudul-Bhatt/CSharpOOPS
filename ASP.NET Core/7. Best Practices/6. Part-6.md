### ASP.NET Core Best Practices

Continuing from the previous points, here are the next three key points explained:

#### 19. Do Not Access HttpContext from Multiple Threads

##### Overview:
`HttpContext` is not thread-safe. Accessing it from multiple threads in parallel can lead to unexpected behavior, such as server crashes, data corruption, and unresponsive applications.

##### Key Points:
- **Thread Safety:**
  - `HttpContext` should only be accessed from the thread handling the request.

- **Avoid Parallel Access:**
  - Do not access `HttpContext` properties or methods from multiple threads.

- **Safe Access:**
  - If you need to perform parallel operations, copy the required data from `HttpContext` before starting parallel tasks.

- **Example:**
  - The following example demonstrates copying data from `HttpContext` before starting parallel operations.

````csharp name=ParallelAccess.cs
public class MyController : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpGet]
    public IActionResult ParallelRequest()
    {
        var requestPath = HttpContext.Request.Path;
        var task1 = Task.Run(() => DoWork(requestPath));
        var task2 = Task.Run(() => DoWork(requestPath));
        Task.WaitAll(task1, task2);
        return Ok();
    }

    private void DoWork(string requestPath)
    {
        // Perform parallel work using the copied requestPath
    }
}
````

#### 20. Do Not Use the HttpContext After the Request is Complete

##### Overview:
`HttpContext` is only valid as long as there is an active HTTP request in the ASP.NET Core pipeline. Using `HttpContext` after the request has completed can result in exceptions and undefined behavior.

##### Key Points:
- **Request Scope:**
  - `HttpContext` is tied to the lifetime of the HTTP request. Once the request is complete, `HttpContext` is no longer valid.

- **Avoid Async Void:**
  - Avoid using `async void` methods, as they can cause the HTTP request to complete prematurely.

- **Safe Handling:**
  - Ensure that all operations using `HttpContext` are completed before the request ends.

- **Example:**
  - The following example demonstrates returning a `Task` to ensure the request does not complete prematurely.

````csharp name=HttpContextAfterRequest.cs
public class MyController : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpGet]
    public async Task<IActionResult> SafeRequest()
    {
        await DoWorkAsync();
        return Ok();
    }

    private async Task DoWorkAsync()
    {
        // Perform async work with HttpContext
        var user = HttpContext.User;
        await Task.Delay(1000); // Simulate async work
    }
}
````

#### 21. Do Not Capture the HttpContext in Background Threads

##### Overview:
Capturing `HttpContext` in background threads can lead to issues because `HttpContext` is valid only during the request's lifetime and is not thread-safe.

##### Key Points:
- **Background Tasks:**
  - Do not capture `HttpContext` in background threads or tasks that run outside the request scope.

- **Correct Handling:**
  - Copy the necessary data from `HttpContext` and pass it to the background task.

- **Use Dependency Injection:**
  - Use dependency injection to access required services in background tasks instead of capturing `HttpContext`.

- **Example:**
  - The following example demonstrates copying data from `HttpContext` and using it in a background task.

````csharp name=BackgroundThreadHttpContext.cs
public class MyController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly IHttpContextAccessor _httpContextAccessor;

    public MyController(IHttpContextAccessor httpContextAccessor)
    {
        _httpContextAccessor = httpContextAccessor;
    }

    [HttpPost]
    public IActionResult StartBackgroundTask()
    {
        var userId = _httpContextAccessor.HttpContext?.User?.FindFirst(ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier)?.Value;
        Task.Run(() => DoBackgroundWork(userId));
        return Ok();
    }

    private void DoBackgroundWork(string userId)
    {
        // Perform background work using the copied userId
        if (userId != null)
        {
            // Simulate background work
        }
    }
}
````

These best practices help in designing high-performance and scalable ASP.NET Core applications by ensuring thread safety, proper request handling, and correct background task execution.
