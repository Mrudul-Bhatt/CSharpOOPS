### ASP.NET Core Best Practices

Continuing from the previous points, here are the next three key points explained:

#### 22. Do Not Capture Services Injected into the Controllers on Background Threads

##### Overview:
Capturing services injected into controllers on background threads can lead to issues because the services may be tied to the request's lifetime and are not thread-safe outside of the request scope.

##### Key Points:
- **Background Tasks:**
  - Do not capture services directly injected into controllers in background threads or tasks that run outside the request scope.

- **Correct Handling:**
  - Use `IServiceScopeFactory` to create a new dependency injection scope in the background thread and resolve services from it.

- **Example:**
  - The following example demonstrates how to use `IServiceScopeFactory` to create a scope for background tasks.

````csharp name=BackgroundThreadServices.cs
public class MyController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly IServiceScopeFactory _serviceScopeFactory;

    public MyController(IServiceScopeFactory serviceScopeFactory)
    {
        _serviceScopeFactory = serviceScopeFactory;
    }

    [HttpPost]
    public IActionResult StartBackgroundTask()
    {
        Task.Run(() => DoBackgroundWork());
        return Ok();
    }

    private void DoBackgroundWork()
    {
        using (var scope = _serviceScopeFactory.CreateScope())
        {
            var myService = scope.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<MyService>();
            // Perform background work using myService
        }
    }
}
````

#### 23. Do Not Modify the Status Code or Headers After the Response Body Has Started

##### Overview:
Once the response body has started, the headers and status code have already been sent to the client. Modifying them afterward can lead to exceptions and undefined behavior.

##### Key Points:
- **Response Headers:**
  - Headers and status code must be set before the response body starts.

- **Check Response Started:**
  - Check if the response has started before modifying headers or status code.

- **Use OnStarting:**
  - Use `HttpResponse.OnStarting` to set headers just before the response starts.

- **Example:**
  - The following example demonstrates checking if the response has started before modifying headers.

````csharp name=ModifyHeadersAfterResponse.cs
public class MyMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;

    public MyMiddleware(RequestDelegate next)
    {
        _next = next;
    }

    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
    {
        if (!context.Response.HasStarted)
        {
            context.Response.Headers["X-Custom-Header"] = "CustomValue";
        }

        await _next(context);
    }
}

public class Startup
{
    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
    {
        app.UseMiddleware<MyMiddleware>();
    }
}
````

#### 24. Do Not Call next() if You Have Already Started Writing to the Response Body

##### Overview:
Middleware components should only call the next middleware in the pipeline if it's possible for them to handle and manipulate the response. If you have already started writing to the response body, calling `next()` can lead to unexpected behavior.

##### Key Points:
- **Middleware Execution:**
  - Ensure that `next()` is only called if the response has not started.

- **Avoid Writing Before next():**
  - Do not start writing to the response body before calling `next()`.

- **Example:**
  - The following example demonstrates proper handling of `next()` in middleware.

````csharp name=CallNextAfterWriting.cs
public class MyMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;

    public MyMiddleware(RequestDelegate next)
    {
        _next = next;
    }

    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
    {
        // Perform some processing before calling next()
        await _next(context);

        if (!context.Response.HasStarted)
        {
            await context.Response.WriteAsync("Middleware response");
        }
    }
}

public class Startup
{
    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
    {
        app.UseMiddleware<MyMiddleware>();
    }
}
````

These best practices help in designing high-performance and scalable ASP.NET Core applications by ensuring proper service handling in background tasks, correct modification of response headers and status codes, and appropriate middleware execution.
