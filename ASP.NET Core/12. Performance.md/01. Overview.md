I wasn't able to retrieve the article directly, but I can provide a summary of key points based on the general principles and recommendations for **ASP.NET Core performance**. Here's a breakdown of the typical performance optimization techniques in ASP.NET Core:

---

# ⚡ **ASP.NET Core Performance – Explained by Points**

---

## 1. **Performance Overview**

ASP.NET Core is designed to be high-performance and lightweight. It is faster than its predecessor, ASP.NET Framework, due to several optimizations in the runtime, libraries, and web server infrastructure.

---

## 2. **Optimize Startup Performance**

### 2.1 **Minimize Dependency Injection (DI) Overhead**
- **Avoid unnecessary dependencies** in the DI container.
- **Eagerly instantiate** services that are needed immediately during startup.

### 2.2 **Use Asynchronous Initialization**
- **Use async operations** during application startup to avoid blocking threads.
  
### Example:

```csharp
public class Startup
{
    public async Task ConfigureAsync(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
    {
        await Task.WhenAll(InitializeServices());
    }

    private Task InitializeServices()
    {
        // Your async initialization logic
    }
}
```

---

## 3. **HTTP Request Handling**

### 3.1 **Use HTTP/2 and HTTPS**
- **HTTP/2** provides **multiplexing**, **header compression**, and other features that improve request performance.
- Use **HTTPS** to enable HTTP/2, as HTTP/2 requires a secure connection.

```csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
{
    app.UseHttpsRedirection();
}
```

### 3.2 **Reduce Response Size**
- Minimize response sizes using **compression**:
  - GZIP for textual content (HTML, JSON, CSS, JS).
  - Brotli for better compression on modern browsers.

```csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
{
    app.UseResponseCompression();
}
```

---

## 4. **Caching**

### 4.1 **Response Caching**
- Cache **frequently accessed data** to reduce redundant work.
- Use **distributed caching** for large-scale applications.

```csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
{
    app.UseResponseCaching();
}
```

### 4.2 **Output Caching**
- Cache complete pages or fragments.
- Use **Time-to-Live (TTL)** for cache expiration.

---

## 5. **Database Performance Optimization**

### 5.1 **Efficient Queries**
- Use **Entity Framework Core (EF Core)** optimally by avoiding **N+1 query problems**.
- Use **compiled queries** for frequently executed queries to improve performance.

```csharp
var compiledQuery = EF.CompileQuery((MyDbContext db) => db.Users.Where(u => u.IsActive));
```

### 5.2 **Connection Pooling**
- Make use of **connection pooling** to avoid the overhead of opening and closing database connections repeatedly.

---

## 6. **Optimize Static Files**

### 6.1 **Serve Static Files Efficiently**
- Use **CDNs** (Content Delivery Networks) for globally distributed static files.
- Enable **cache control headers** to make sure static files are cached at the client side.

```csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
{
    app.UseStaticFiles(new StaticFileOptions
    {
        OnPrepareResponse = ctx =>
        {
            ctx.Context.Response.Headers[HeaderNames.CacheControl] = "public, max-age=86400";
        }
    });
}
```

### 6.2 **Minify CSS, JavaScript, and HTML**
- Use **bundling** and **minification** to reduce file sizes and improve load times.

---

## 7. **Avoid Blocking Calls in Async Code**

- **Avoid synchronous operations** in asynchronous code to prevent thread starvation.
- Use `async` and `await` for non-blocking IO operations.

---

## 8. **Thread Pool and Parallelism**

### 8.1 **Limit Threads in IO-bound Operations**
- Use **async programming patterns** for IO-bound tasks to prevent blocking threads.
- Use the `ConfigureAwait(false)` to avoid unnecessary synchronization context in certain cases.

```csharp
public async Task MyTask()
{
    var result = await SomeIoBoundTask().ConfigureAwait(false);
}
```

---

## 9. **Logging and Diagnostics**

### 9.1 **Efficient Logging**
- Use **asynchronous logging** for non-blocking operations.
- Log only necessary data to avoid performance penalties in production.

### 9.2 **Use Performance Profilers**
- Tools like **Application Insights**, **BenchmarkDotNet**, and **dotnet trace** help identify bottlenecks in your application.

---

## 10. **Memory and Garbage Collection**

### 10.1 **Avoid Memory Leaks**
- Use **strongly-typed objects** and **reuse objects** instead of creating new ones.
- Optimize memory usage with **memory pools**.

### 10.2 **Garbage Collection Tuning**
- Tune the **garbage collector** settings for high-performance applications, especially for large-scale applications.

---

## 11. **Asynchronous Middleware**

- Middleware can be configured asynchronously to improve performance, especially in cases of external API calls or heavy database interactions.

```csharp
public class CustomMiddleware
{
    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context, RequestDelegate next)
    {
        // Asynchronous logic
        await next(context);
    }
}
```

---

## 12. **Profiling and Benchmarking**

- Always benchmark and **profile your application** to identify the areas that need optimization.
- Use tools like **BenchmarkDotNet**, **dotnet-counters**, or **dotnet-trace**.
