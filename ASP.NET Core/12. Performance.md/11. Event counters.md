The Microsoft Docs article **"Tutorial: Measure performance using EventCounters in .NET Core"** provides a hands-on guide to instrumenting your .NET Core application with custom performance metrics using the `EventCounter` class. Here's a **point-by-point summary**:

---

## 🧪 1. **Purpose of EventCounters**

- **EventCounters** are designed for measuring high-frequency events with minimal overhead, making them suitable for real-time performance monitoring.
- They allow you to collect statistics within the application and report them periodically, rather than logging every individual event. ([Tutorial: Measure performance using EventCounters in .NET Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/diagnostics/event-counter-perf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

---

## 🛠️ 2. **Implementing an EventSource**

- Create a class that inherits from `System.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource`.
- Define an `EventCounter` for the metric you wish to track.
- Use the `WriteMetric` method to report the value of the metric. ([EventCounter Class (System.Diagnostics.Tracing) - Learn Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/lb-lu/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.tracing.eventcounter?view=netcore-1.0&utm_source=chatgpt.com))

Example:


```csharp
using System.Diagnostics.Tracing;

[EventSource(Name = "Sample.EventCounter.Minimal")]
public sealed class MinimalEventCounterSource : EventSource
{
    public static readonly MinimalEventCounterSource Log = new MinimalEventCounterSource();

    private EventCounter _requestCounter;

    private MinimalEventCounterSource() =>
        _requestCounter = new EventCounter("request-time", this)
        {
            DisplayName = "Request Processing Time",
            DisplayUnits = "ms"
        };

    public void Request(string url, long elapsedMilliseconds)
    {
        WriteEvent(1, url, elapsedMilliseconds);
        _requestCounter?.WriteMetric(elapsedMilliseconds);
    }

    protected override void Dispose(bool disposing)
    {
        _requestCounter?.Dispose();
        _requestCounter = null;

        base.Dispose(disposing);
    }
}
```

## 🧩 3. **Integrating with ASP.NET Core**

- Implement an action filter that measures the time taken to process each HTTP request.
- In the `OnActionExecuted` method, use the `EventCounter` to report the elapsed time.

Example: ([Diagnostics tools overview - .NET Core - Learn Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/diagnostics/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))


```csharp
using System.Diagnostics;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Extensions;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Filters;

namespace DiagnosticScenarios
{
    public class LogRequestTimeFilterAttribute : ActionFilterAttribute
    {
        readonly Stopwatch _stopwatch = new Stopwatch();

        public override void OnActionExecuting(ActionExecutingContext context) => _stopwatch.Start();

        public override void OnActionExecuted(ActionExecutedContext context)
        {
            _stopwatch.Stop();

            MinimalEventCounterSource.Log.Request(
                context.HttpContext.Request.GetDisplayUrl(), _stopwatch.ElapsedMilliseconds);
        }
    }
}
```

## 🧪 4. **Monitoring with dotnet-counters**

- Use the `dotnet-counters` tool to monitor the custom event counters in real-time.
- Run the following command to monitor the `request-time` counter: ([Collect metrics - .NET | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/diagnostics/metrics-collection?utm_source=chatgpt.com))


```bash
dotnet-counters monitor --process-id <PID> --counters Sample.EventCounter.Minimal
```


This command will display the values of the `request-time` counter as they are reported by the application.

## ✅ 5. **Best Practices**

- **Low Overhead**: Ensure that the overhead per event is minimal (less than a millisecond) to avoid impacting application performance.
- **Periodic Reporting**: Instead of logging every individual event, aggregate statistics and report them periodically to reduce overhead.
- **Use in High-Frequency Scenarios**: Ideal for scenarios where events occur frequently, such as web request processing or background tasks.
