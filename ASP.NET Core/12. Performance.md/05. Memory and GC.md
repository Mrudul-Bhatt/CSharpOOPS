Here is a **point-by-point explanation** of the Microsoft Docs article **"Memory management and garbage collection (GC) in ASP.NET Core"**, which focuses on how .NET manages memory in ASP.NET Core applications and how developers can optimize performance.

# ðŸ§  Memory Management and Garbage Collection (GC) in ASP.NET Core â€“ Key Points

---

## 1. **Managed Memory in .NET**

- .NET uses **automatic memory management** via the **Garbage Collector (GC)**.
- You allocate objects using `new`, and the GC automatically frees memory that is no longer in use.

---

## 2. **Garbage Collection (GC) Basics**

- The **GC** reclaims memory by removing objects that are no longer reachable from the application code.
- It works in the background and is **non-deterministic**â€”you canâ€™t control exactly when it runs.
- .NET GC categorizes objects into **generations**:
  - **Gen 0**: Short-lived objects (e.g., local variables)
  - **Gen 1**: Medium-lived objects
  - **Gen 2**: Long-lived objects (e.g., static data, cached items)

---

## 3. **Server vs. Workstation GC Modes**

- **Workstation GC**: Optimized for responsiveness (desktop apps).
- **Server GC**: Optimized for throughput and multi-threading (used by ASP.NET Core apps).

> ASP.NET Core uses **Server GC by default** for better scalability.

You can configure GC mode in `runtimeconfig.json` or `csproj`:

```xml
<ServerGarbageCollection>true</ServerGarbageCollection>
```

---

## 4. **GC Settings in Azure App Service**

- **Server GC** is enabled by default in **Azure App Services**.
- To change it, use the `runtimeconfig.json` file or Application Settings.

---

## 5. **GC and Application Performance**

- GC introduces **pauses**â€”called **GC latency**â€”which can impact request performance if not tuned.
- Server GC minimizes latency and supports concurrent collection on multi-core systems.

---

## 6. **Memory Leaks in ASP.NET Core**

- Common causes:
  - **Static references** that are never cleared
  - **Event handlers** not detached
  - **Caching** without size limits
- Use tools like:
  - **dotnet-counters**
  - **dotnet-gcdump**
  - **Visual Studio Diagnostic Tools**
  - **PerfView**

To detect memory leaks or high memory usage.

---

## 7. **Reducing Allocations**

- Reuse objects instead of creating new ones.
- Use `Span<T>`, `Memory<T>`, and **array pooling** (`ArrayPool<T>.Shared`) to reduce GC pressure.
- Use **value types (structs)** where appropriate to avoid heap allocation.

---

## 8. **Avoiding Finalizers and Large Object Heap (LOH)**

- Finalizers delay object cleanup. Avoid them unless needed (e.g., for unmanaged resources).
- **Large Object Heap (LOH)** stores objects > 85,000 bytes.
  - These are only collected during Gen 2 collections, which are less frequent.
  - Avoid allocating large arrays unnecessarily.

---

## 9. **Use of `IAsyncDisposable`**

- For releasing memory/resources in asynchronous scenarios, use `IAsyncDisposable`.

```csharp
public class MyService : IAsyncDisposable
{
    public ValueTask DisposeAsync()
    {
        // Clean up async resources
    }
}
```

---

## 10. **Recommended Practices**

- **Limit object allocation** in high-throughput paths (e.g., inside request loops).
- Avoid excessive object graphs or circular references.
- Use **pooled objects** (e.g., `ObjectPool<T>`) where possible.
- Profile memory usage regularly.
