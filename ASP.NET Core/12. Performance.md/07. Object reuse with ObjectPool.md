The Microsoft Docs article **"Object reuse with ObjectPool in ASP.NET Core"** explains how to improve performance by reusing objects rather than allocating new ones, especially in high-throughput scenarios. Here's a **point-by-point explanation**:

---

## 🔁 1. What is `ObjectPool`?

- `ObjectPool<T>` is a .NET Core feature that **reuses instances** of objects instead of creating new ones every time.
- Especially useful for **expensive-to-create objects** (e.g., parsers, builders).
- Available via the **Microsoft.Extensions.ObjectPool** namespace.

---

## 🧠 2. Why Use Object Pooling?

- **Reduces GC pressure** by reusing objects instead of constant allocation/deallocation.
- **Improves performance** in high-load applications such as ASP.NET Core APIs, background jobs, etc.
- Minimizes latency introduced by frequent memory allocation.

## 🏗️ 3. Basic Usage

You can use `DefaultObjectPool<T>` or create a custom one.

### a. Define a Pooled Object

```csharp
public class MyReusableObject
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
}
```

### b. Use `DefaultObjectPool`

```csharp
var provider = new DefaultObjectPoolProvider();
var pool = provider.Create<MyReusableObject>();

var obj = pool.Get();
// Use the object...
pool.Return(obj); // Return it for reuse
```

---

## ⚙️ 4. Customize Object Creation with `IPooledObjectPolicy<T>`

To define how objects are created and reset:

```csharp
public class MyObjectPolicy : IPooledObjectPolicy<MyReusableObject>
{
    public MyReusableObject Create() => new MyReusableObject();

    public bool Return(MyReusableObject obj)
    {
        obj.Id = 0;
        obj.Name = null;
        return true;
    }
}
```

Register and use the custom policy:

```csharp
var pool = new DefaultObjectPool<MyReusableObject>(new MyObjectPolicy());
```

---

## 🧰 5. Using Object Pools in Dependency Injection (DI)

In `Startup.cs` or `Program.cs`:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddSingleton<ObjectPoolProvider, DefaultObjectPoolProvider>();
builder.Services.AddSingleton<ObjectPool<MyReusableObject>>(sp =>
{
    var provider = sp.GetRequiredService<ObjectPoolProvider>();
    return provider.Create<MyReusableObject>();
});
```

Use in your class:

```csharp
public class MyService
{
    private readonly ObjectPool<MyReusableObject> _pool;

    public MyService(ObjectPool<MyReusableObject> pool)
    {
        _pool = pool;
    }

    public void DoWork()
    {
        var obj = _pool.Get();
        try
        {
            // Use obj
        }
        finally
        {
            _pool.Return(obj);
        }
    }
}
```

## 🔒 6. Thread Safety

- `ObjectPool<T>` is **thread-safe** and designed to be used in multithreaded applications like web servers.

---

## 🧪 7. When to Use Object Pooling

✅ Use when:
- You have objects that are **expensive to allocate**.
- Objects are **used frequently and briefly**.
- The app is **high-throughput** (e.g., handling thousands of requests per second).

🚫 Avoid when:
- Object creation is cheap.
- Objects maintain **state** that is hard to reset.
- You need strict control over object lifetime.

---

## 📦 8. Available Pool Types

- `DefaultObjectPool<T>` – No limit on pool size.
- `DefaultPooledObjectPolicy<T>` – Default policy for creating and returning objects.
- `LeakTrackingObjectPool<T>` – Useful in testing to track object leaks.
