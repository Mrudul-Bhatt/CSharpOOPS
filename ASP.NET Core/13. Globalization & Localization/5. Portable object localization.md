The article **"Configure portable object localization in ASP.NET Core"** from Microsoft Docs explains how to use **Portable Object Localization (POL)** in ASP.NET Core applications. This approach allows you to store localized strings in resource files using a **.po** file format, which is a more portable and human-readable way of handling translations, often used in scenarios involving different platforms or frameworks.

Here’s a **point-by-point summary** of the key concepts from the article:

---

## 1. **Introduction to Portable Object Localization (POL)**

- **Portable Object Localization** allows for easier internationalization and localization by storing resources in **.po** and **.mo** files. These files are widely used in open-source software and can be easily translated by various translation tools.
- POL in ASP.NET Core helps centralize translations and provides a more straightforward process for updating and managing localized strings.

---

## 2. **Install the Necessary Packages**

- To enable POL in ASP.NET Core, you need to install specific packages that facilitate working with `.po` and `.mo` files.

```bash
dotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.Localization.PO
```

This package integrates the **Portable Object Localization** functionality into your ASP.NET Core app.

---

## 3. **Configure the Localization in Startup**

In the `Startup.cs` file, you need to configure the localization services and specify the path where the `.po` files will be stored.

### a. **Configure Services**

You can configure localization in the `ConfigureServices` method by adding the required localization services:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddLocalization(options => options.ResourcesPath = "Localization");
}
```

- The `ResourcesPath` specifies where the `.po` files will be located in the project directory.

### b. **Use Portable Object Localization in the Middleware**

In the `Configure` method of `Startup.cs`, you need to enable localization middleware to support language/culture selection:

```csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
    var supportedCultures = new[] { "en-US", "fr-FR" };
    
    app.UseRequestLocalization(options =>
    {
        options.SetDefaultCulture("en-US")
               .AddSupportedCultures(supportedCultures)
               .AddSupportedUICultures(supportedCultures);
    });
}
```

- This setup enables the app to work with different cultures, and the localization provider will pull translations from `.po` files for supported languages.

---

## 4. **Create and Manage `.po` Files**

### a. **Create PO Files**

- You will need to create `.po` files for each language you want to support.
- These files are typically placed in a `Localization` folder, and the filenames follow the pattern: `messages.{language}.po`.

For example:
- `messages.en-US.po` for English
- `messages.fr-FR.po` for French

Each `.po` file contains key-value pairs where keys represent the strings, and values are their translations.

---

## 5. **Using Localized Strings in Your Application**

Once you’ve configured POL, you can use localized strings in your controllers and views.

### a. **In Controllers**

Inject the `IStringLocalizer` service into your controller and use it to fetch localized content:

```csharp
private readonly IStringLocalizer<SharedResources> _localizer;

public MyController(IStringLocalizer<SharedResources> localizer)
{
    _localizer = localizer;
}

public IActionResult Index()
{
    var greeting = _localizer["Greeting"];
    return View("Index", greeting);
}
```

### b. **In Views**

In Razor views, you can access localized strings similarly:

```csharp
@inject IStringLocalizer<SharedResources> localizer

<p>@localizer["Greeting"]</p>
```

This will automatically display the correct translation based on the current culture.

---

## 6. **Compiling PO Files to MO Files**

While `.po` files are human-readable and great for translation, the app needs **`.mo` files** (Machine Object files) for optimized use at runtime. These `.mo` files are the compiled version of the `.po` files and are used by the application.

You can use tools like **Poedit** or **gettext** to compile `.po` files into `.mo` files, which should be placed alongside the `.po` files for the app to consume.

---

## 7. **Best Practices**

- **Use Clear Key Names**: Ensure that your keys in `.po` files are clear and descriptive, so they are easily translatable.
- **Fallbacks**: Configure appropriate fallbacks in case a translation is missing in the selected culture (e.g., default to English).
- **Translation Management**: Utilize translation tools (like Poedit) to simplify the management and editing of `.po` files.

---

## 8. **Advantages of POL in ASP.NET Core**

- **Human-Readable Format**: `.po` files are text-based and easy to edit, making them ideal for translators who don't need to work with complex code.
- **Cross-Platform**: POL is widely supported in various environments, making it easier to share translations between different frameworks and platforms.
- **Standardization**: Using `.po` and `.mo` files brings consistency to the localization process and is a widely used approach in open-source software.
