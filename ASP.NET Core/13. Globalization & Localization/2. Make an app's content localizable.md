The article **"Make an ASP.NET Core app's content localizable"** from Microsoft Docs helps developers configure an ASP.NET Core application to support multiple languages by making its content localizable. Here's a **point-by-point summary** of the key concepts:

---

## 🌍 1. **Introduction to Localization**

- **Localization** refers to adapting an application to support multiple languages and regional differences.
- In ASP.NET Core, content can be localized by using **resource files**, which store language-specific strings.
- Localization allows your app to cater to users from different cultures by adjusting text, numbers, dates, and other culture-specific elements.

---

## 📦 2. **Steps for Making Content Localizable**

### a. **Install Localization Packages**

To enable localization, install the necessary packages:

```bash
dotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.Localization
dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Localization
```

### b. **Create Resource Files**

- Create `.resx` files for each language and culture.
- These files contain the localized strings, which are identified by keys.

For example:

1. `Resources/SharedResources.en-US.resx` for English content.
2. `Resources/SharedResources.fr-FR.resx` for French content.

### c. **Define Resource Keys**

Each `.resx` file stores key-value pairs where the key is a unique identifier for the string and the value is the localized text.

Example:
- `Greeting` key in `SharedResources.en-US.resx`:
  - `Greeting = "Hello!"`
- `Greeting` key in `SharedResources.fr-FR.resx`:
  - `Greeting = "Bonjour!"`

---

## 🛠️ 3. **Configure Localization in Startup**

### a. **Configure Services**

In the `ConfigureServices` method of `Startup.cs`, register localization services:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddLocalization(options => options.ResourcesPath = "Resources");
}
```

### b. **Configure Middleware**

In the `Configure` method of `Startup.cs`, add the localization middleware:

```csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
    var supportedCultures = new[] { "en-US", "fr-FR", "de-DE" };
    var cultureInfo = new CultureInfo("en-US");

    app.UseRequestLocalization(options => 
        options.SetDefaultCulture("en-US")
               .AddSupportedCultures(supportedCultures)
               .AddSupportedUICultures(supportedCultures));
}
```

- The `UseRequestLocalization` middleware ensures that the culture and UI culture are set based on the user’s request.

---

## 📚 4. **Localize Strings in Controllers and Views**

### a. **In Controllers**

Inject `IStringLocalizer<T>` into controllers to access localized strings.

Example:
```csharp
private readonly IStringLocalizer<SharedResources> _localizer;

public MyController(IStringLocalizer<SharedResources> localizer)
{
    _localizer = localizer;
}

public IActionResult Index()
{
    ViewData["Message"] = _localizer["Greeting"];
    return View();
}
```

### b. **In Views**

In Razor views, use the `IStringLocalizer` to display localized strings:

```csharp
@inject IStringLocalizer<SharedResources> localizer
<p>@localizer["Greeting"]</p>
```

---

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 5. **Support for Multiple Cultures**

- ASP.NET Core supports multiple cultures and UI cultures.
- You can define multiple resource files for each language and region.
- The application will automatically select the correct resources based on the user’s locale or preferences.

---

## 📅 6. **Date, Time, and Number Localization**

ASP.NET Core can automatically format dates, times, and numbers according to the user’s culture.

Example for formatting:
```csharp
decimal price = 1234.56m;
var formattedPrice = price.ToString("C", CultureInfo.CurrentCulture);
```

---

## 🧳 7. **Setting Culture in the Application**

You can set the user’s preferred culture by examining the `Accept-Language` header or by using cookies.

Example:
```csharp
app.UseRequestLocalization(options =>
{
    options.AddSupportedCultures("en-US", "fr-FR")
           .AddSupportedUICultures("en-US", "fr-FR")
           .SetDefaultCulture("en-US");
});
```

---

## 🔄 8. **Fallback Mechanism**

- If a resource for the selected culture is unavailable, ASP.NET Core will fall back to the default culture (usually `en-US`).
- You can customize the fallback mechanism by adjusting the `RequestLocalizationOptions`.

---

## ✅ 9. **Best Practices for Localization**

- Store all strings in `.resx` files for easy maintenance.
- Use meaningful resource keys and organize them in separate files for different sections or components of your app.
- Ensure your application can handle culture-specific differences, such as date formats and currency symbols.
- Test your app in different cultures to ensure the content is correctly localized.
