The article **"Implement a strategy to select the language/culture for each request in a localized ASP.NET Core app"** from Microsoft Docs explains various strategies to select the appropriate language and culture for each request in a localized ASP.NET Core application. Here’s a **point-by-point summary** of the key concepts:

---

## 🌍 1. **Culture and Language Selection in ASP.NET Core**

- ASP.NET Core applications can be localized to support multiple languages and cultures.
- The **culture** determines how the app handles culture-sensitive data (dates, times, numbers), and the **language** is used for translating text.
- You need to implement a strategy to select the appropriate culture for each incoming request based on user preferences.

---

## 🛠️ 2. **Setting the Culture for Each Request**

### a. **Default Culture**

- You can set a default culture for the app, which will be used if no culture is specified in the request.
  
Example:
```csharp
var supportedCultures = new[] { "en-US", "fr-FR", "de-DE" };
app.UseRequestLocalization(options =>
{
    options.SetDefaultCulture("en-US")
           .AddSupportedCultures(supportedCultures)
           .AddSupportedUICultures(supportedCultures);
});
```

In this example, `en-US` is set as the default culture.

---

## 🌐 3. **Culture Selection Strategies**

### a. **Query String Culture Selection**

- One common approach is to specify the culture through the query string in the URL (e.g., `?culture=fr-FR`).
  
Example:
```csharp
app.UseRequestLocalization(options =>
{
    options.AddSupportedCultures("en-US", "fr-FR")
           .SetDefaultCulture("en-US")
           .RequestCultureProviders.Insert(0, new QueryStringRequestCultureProvider());
});
```

- This strategy reads the `culture` query parameter and sets the culture accordingly.

---

### b. **Cookie-Based Culture Selection**

- You can use a cookie to store the selected culture so that the user’s preference persists across requests.

Example:
```csharp
app.UseRequestLocalization(options =>
{
    options.AddSupportedCultures("en-US", "fr-FR")
           .SetDefaultCulture("en-US")
           .RequestCultureProviders.Insert(0, new CookieRequestCultureProvider());
});
```

- The culture will be stored in a cookie, and future requests will use the culture specified in that cookie.

---

### c. **Accept-Language Header**

- You can select the culture based on the `Accept-Language` header sent by the browser, which typically indicates the user’s preferred language.

Example:
```csharp
app.UseRequestLocalization(options =>
{
    options.AddSupportedCultures("en-US", "fr-FR")
           .SetDefaultCulture("en-US")
           .RequestCultureProviders.Insert(0, new AcceptLanguageHeaderRequestCultureProvider());
});
```

- This strategy automatically selects the culture based on the browser’s settings.

---

## 🔄 4. **Custom Culture Selection**

- You can implement a custom strategy to select the culture based on any business logic or user-specific information (e.g., preferences stored in a database or user profile).
  
Example:
```csharp
public class CustomRequestCultureProvider : IRequestCultureProvider
{
    public Task<ProviderCultureResult> DetermineProviderCultureResult(HttpContext httpContext)
    {
        // Custom logic to determine the culture, for example, based on user info
        var culture = httpContext.User?.FindFirst("Culture")?.Value ?? "en-US";
        return Task.FromResult(new ProviderCultureResult(culture));
    }
}

app.UseRequestLocalization(options =>
{
    options.AddSupportedCultures("en-US", "fr-FR")
           .SetDefaultCulture("en-US")
           .RequestCultureProviders.Insert(0, new CustomRequestCultureProvider());
});
```

---

## 📅 5. **Localization Fallback Mechanism**

- If a resource for a specific culture is unavailable, ASP.NET Core will fall back to the default culture.
- You can also customize the fallback behavior by adjusting the `RequestLocalizationOptions`.

---

## 🧳 6. **Best Practices**

- **Store user preferences**: Use cookies or session data to store and remember a user’s language and culture preferences.
- **Set appropriate fallback**: Ensure a sensible fallback culture is configured in case the requested culture is unavailable.
- **Handle culture updates**: Allow users to switch cultures dynamically in your app by setting the culture in a cookie or query string.
- **Test different cultures**: Verify that the app works as expected in different languages and regions, especially for features like dates, numbers, and translations.
