Here’s a point-by-point explanation of the Microsoft Docs article **“Razor Pages authorization conventions in ASP.NET Core”** — which explains how to apply authorization rules to Razor Pages using conventions instead of manually adding attributes.

## 🔐 **Razor Pages Authorization Conventions in ASP.NET Core** — Key Points

---

### 🔹 1. **What Are Razor Pages Authorization Conventions?**

- Instead of using `[Authorize]` attributes on each page, **authorization conventions** allow you to define access rules globally for Razor Pages in `Startup.cs` or `Program.cs`.
- Conventions are applied at **startup** using the `AddRazorPagesOptions()` method.

---

### 🔹 2. **Enable Authorization in Razor Pages**

- Register authentication and authorization in `Program.cs`:
```csharp
builder.Services.AddAuthorization();
builder.Services.AddRazorPages()
    .AddRazorPagesOptions(options =>
    {
        // Add conventions here
    });
```

---

### 🔹 3. **Authorize a Folder**

- Restrict access to all pages in a folder:
```csharp
options.Conventions.AuthorizeFolder("/Admin");
```
✅ All pages under `/Pages/Admin/*` now require authentication.

---

### 🔹 4. **Authorize a Specific Page**

- Restrict access to a specific page only:
```csharp
options.Conventions.AuthorizePage("/Account/Profile");
```
✅ `/Pages/Account/Profile.cshtml` is now protected.

---

### 🔹 5. **Allow Anonymous Access to a Folder or Page**

- To **allow anonymous access** to specific content in a protected folder:
```csharp
options.Conventions.AllowAnonymousToPage("/Admin/Login");
options.Conventions.AllowAnonymousToFolder("/Public");
```
✅ Useful when most pages are restricted but a few should be publicly accessible.

---

### 🔹 6. **Use a Specific Authorization Policy**

- Assign a named policy to a folder or page:
```csharp
options.Conventions.AuthorizeFolder("/Staff", "StaffOnly");
options.Conventions.AuthorizePage("/Account/Settings", "CanEditSettings");
```
✅ These policies are defined in the `AddAuthorization` setup:
```csharp
builder.Services.AddAuthorization(options =>
{
    options.AddPolicy("StaffOnly", policy =>
        policy.RequireRole("Staff"));
});
```

---

### 🔹 7. **Custom Page Application Model Conventions**

- Advanced: create your **own convention** class that implements `IPageApplicationModelConvention`.
- Use this to apply more dynamic or conditional logic to Razor Pages during startup.

Example:
```csharp
public class CustomAuthConvention : IPageApplicationModelConvention
{
    public void Apply(PageApplicationModel model)
    {
        if (model.ViewEnginePath.Contains("Secure"))
        {
            model.Filters.Add(new AuthorizeFilter());
        }
    }
}
```

---

### 🔹 8. **Benefits of Using Conventions**

- Cleaner code: no need for repetitive `[Authorize]` attributes.
- Centralized security logic.
- Easier to enforce folder-wide or policy-based access rules.

### ✅ Summary Table

| Convention Method                            | Description                                           |
|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `AuthorizeFolder("/Folder")`                 | Require auth for all pages in a folder                |
| `AuthorizePage("/Page")`                     | Require auth for a specific page                      |
| `AuthorizeFolder(..., "PolicyName")`         | Apply a named policy to a folder                      |
| `AllowAnonymousToPage("/Page")`              | Exclude a page from auth requirement                  |
| `AllowAnonymousToFolder("/Folder")`          | Exclude a folder from auth requirement                |
