## üîë Data Protection Key Management and Lifetime in ASP.NET Core

This article explains how **ASP.NET Core Data Protection** manages encryption keys used for securing sensitive data like cookies, tokens, and form data.

---

### üîπ 1. **What is a Key Ring?**

- A **key ring** is a collection of **cryptographic keys** used by the Data Protection API.
- Keys are used to:
    - **Encrypt (protect)** data.
    - **Decrypt (unprotect)** previously encrypted data.
- It contains the **current key** and **older keys** for backward compatibility.

---

### üîπ 2. **Default Key Management Behavior**

- **Automatic key generation** is enabled by default.
- A new key is automatically created **every 90 days**.
- The most recent key becomes the **default active key** used for encryption.
- Older keys are retained to support decryption of previously protected data.

---

### üîπ 3. **Key Lifetime Configuration**

You can change how long a key is valid:

```csharp
services.AddDataProtection()
    .SetDefaultKeyLifetime(TimeSpan.FromDays(30));
```

- Default = **90 days**
- After expiration, the system auto-generates a new key.

---

### üîπ 4. **Key Activation, Expiration, and Revocation**

Each key has three important time values:

- **Creation Date**: When the key was generated.
- **Activation Date**: When the key becomes valid for encryption.
- **Expiration Date**: When the key is no longer used for encryption (but still usable for decryption).
- **Revocation Date (optional)**: When the key is explicitly marked as **untrusted**.

---

### üîπ 5. **Revoking Keys**

- Keys can be manually **revoked** if compromised.
- Revoked keys:
    - Cannot be used to **protect** new data.
    - By default, **cannot unprotect** old data unless you opt in using:

```csharp
services.AddDataProtection()
    .AllowUnprotectingWithRevokedKeys();
```

---

### üîπ 6. **Disable Automatic Key Generation**

To prevent the system from auto-generating new keys:

```csharp
services.AddDataProtection()
    .DisableAutomaticKeyGeneration();
```

‚úÖ Useful in scenarios where keys are **managed manually** (e.g., security compliance environments).

---

### üîπ 7. **Where Keys Are Stored**

By default:
- **In-memory only** (lost on restart).

You can **persist keys** to:
- File system:
  ```csharp
  .PersistKeysToFileSystem(new DirectoryInfo(@"c:\keys"))
  ```
- Azure Blob Storage
- Redis
- Database (via custom `IXmlRepository`)

---

### üîπ 8. **Protecting Keys at Rest**

For added security, protect persisted keys:

- **Windows**:
  ```csharp
  .ProtectKeysWithDpapi()
  ```

- **Cross-platform** (Linux/macOS):
  ```csharp
  .ProtectKeysWithCertificate(certificate)
  ```

---

### üîπ 9. **Inspecting and Managing Keys**

- Keys are XML files stored in the key ring folder (e.g., `c:\keys`).
- They include metadata:
    - Key ID
    - Creation date
    - Activation/expiration
    - Encryption algorithm
- You can inspect or delete keys manually‚Äîbut be cautious!

---

### üîπ 10. **Key Rotation Strategy**

- Keep **older keys** to support data decryption.
- Rotate keys **before expiration** to maintain a strong security posture.
- Consider **backing up** keys and storing them securely (e.g., Azure Key Vault).

### ‚úÖ Summary Table

| Feature                         | Description |
|----------------------------------|-------------|
| Key lifetime                    | Default is 90 days; customizable |
| Key rotation                    | New keys are auto-generated at expiration |
| Key storage                     | File system, Azure Blob, Redis, etc. |
| Revoked keys                    | Cannot be used unless explicitly allowed |
| Protecting keys at rest         | Use DPAPI or certificates |
| Manual key management           | Possible with `DisableAutomaticKeyGeneration()` |
| Key inspection                  | Keys are stored as XML with metadata |
