# ðŸ“š Authenticated Encryption Details in ASP.NET Core

This article explains **how data is encrypted and protected** internally by the ASP.NET Core Data Protection APIs using authenticated encryption techniques.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 1. **What is Authenticated Encryption?**

- **Encryption** ensures that data remains **confidential** (only authorized parties can read it).
- **Authentication** ensures **integrity** (the data hasn't been tampered with).
- **Authenticated Encryption** combines both: encrypts and then verifies the data using a cryptographic signature.

**Result**: If the data is altered, the app will detect it during decryption.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 2. **Default Algorithms Used**

ASP.NET Core Data Protection uses:
- **AES-256-CBC** (Advanced Encryption Standard with 256-bit key and CBC mode) for **encryption**.
- **HMACSHA256** (Hash-based Message Authentication Code with SHA-256) for **validation**.

âœ… These defaults are **secure** and **suitable for general-purpose applications**.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 3. **Encrypt-then-Authenticate Workflow**

The process followed is:

1. **Encrypt** the plaintext using AES-256-CBC.
2. **Generate an HMAC** over the ciphertext.
3. **Concatenate** the HMAC and ciphertext.
4. During decryption, **verify** the HMAC before decrypting.

**Important**:  
If the HMAC validation fails, **decryption is aborted** â€” preventing attackers from tampering undetected.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 4. **How Initialization Vectors (IVs) Work**

- Each encryption operation generates a **new, random IV**.
- IV ensures that **identical plaintexts encrypt differently** each time.

The IV is stored alongside the ciphertext because it's needed for decryption.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 5. **Payload Format**

The final protected payload structure is:

| Part | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Version header | Indicates format version |
| Key ID | Identifies the key used |
| IV | Initialization Vector for AES |
| Ciphertext | Encrypted data |
| HMAC | Integrity verification tag |

âœ… This structure ensures **future compatibility** (e.g., new versions could change encryption schemes without breaking old data).

---

## ðŸ”¹ 6. **Key Derivation**

- A **master key** is used to derive two keys:
  - One for **encryption**.
  - One for **authentication**.
  
- This uses a **Key Derivation Function (KDF)**, which ensures that even if one key leaks, the other remains safe.

**Example**:
```plaintext
Encryption Key = KDF(masterKey, "encryption")
Validation Key = KDF(masterKey, "validation")
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ 7. **Changing Default Algorithms**

You can configure different encryption and validation algorithms.

Example:

```csharp
services.AddDataProtection()
    .UseCryptographicAlgorithms(new AuthenticatedEncryptorConfiguration
    {
        EncryptionAlgorithm = EncryptionAlgorithm.AES_256_CBC,
        ValidationAlgorithm = ValidationAlgorithm.HMACSHA512
    });
```

Other available options:
- **Encryption**: AES-GCM (authenticated encryption), AES-CBC.
- **Validation**: HMACSHA256, HMACSHA512.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 8. **Authenticated Encryption Providers**

There are two built-in providers:
- **Managed** (`ManagedAuthenticatedEncryptor`)  
  Uses .NET libraries like `System.Security.Cryptography`.

- **CNG** (`CngAuthenticatedEncryptor`) (Windows only)  
  Uses Windows Cryptography Next Generation (CNG) APIs.

The system chooses the best one based on platform and configuration.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 9. **Security Best Practices**

- **Never reuse encryption keys** across different apps unless explicitly needed.
- **Regularly rotate** encryption keys.
- **Protect keys at rest** (e.g., use DPAPI, certificates).
- Use **purpose strings** to isolate different uses of data protection.

---

## âœ… Quick Summary Table

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Encryption | AES-256-CBC |
| Validation | HMACSHA256 |
| IV | Randomized for each encryption |
| Structure | Version + Key ID + IV + Ciphertext + HMAC |
| Customization | Supported for algorithms |
| Key derivation | Separate keys for encryption and HMAC |
