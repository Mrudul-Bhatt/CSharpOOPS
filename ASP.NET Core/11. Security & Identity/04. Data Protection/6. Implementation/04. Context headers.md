# ðŸ“š Context Headers in ASP.NET Core Data Protection

This article explains the concept of **context headers** used internally by **ASP.NET Core Data Protection** to **bind protected data to a particular context** and make it **more secure**.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 1. **What are Context Headers?**

- A **context header** is **extra, unencrypted metadata** attached to protected (encrypted) payloads.
- It **binds** the encrypted data to a specific use case, purpose, or configuration.
- Ensures that data **can't be reused** incorrectly in a different context.

âœ… **Example**: An authentication cookie encrypted for App A cannot be decrypted by App B even if both share encryption keys, thanks to context headers.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 2. **Purpose of Context Headers**

- **Defend against key reuse attacks**.
- **Scope protected data** to specific purposes and apps.
- **Ensure cryptographic separation** without requiring separate keys.

They act as **"hidden labels"** that confirm which app/feature created the encrypted data.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 3. **Where Context Headers Are Used**

Context headers are attached to:

- Authentication cookies
- TempData
- Anti-forgery tokens
- Identity tokens (email confirmation, password reset links)

Basically, **any data protected** via ASP.NET Core Data Protection.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 4. **How Context Headers Are Built**

Each protected payload includes:
- **Purpose chain** (your application's purpose string(s))
- **Application discriminator** (app name, if set)
- **Cryptographic configuration version** (format version)

These are combined into the context header.

Example contents:

```plaintext
Purpose: "ContosoApp.Auth.Tokens"
Application: "ContosoApp"
Version: 1
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ 5. **Impact During Decryption**

- During **unprotection**, the system **checks the context header**.
- If the header **does not match** the current app's expectations:
  - **Decryption fails** immediately (throws a `CryptographicException`).
- Protects against:
  - Cross-application decryption.
  - Cross-purpose misuse (e.g., trying to read a cookie as a token).

---

## ðŸ”¹ 6. **No Developer Action Needed (Usually)**

- Context headers are handled **automatically** by ASP.NET Coreâ€™s Data Protection APIs.
- Developers typically just configure:
  - **Purpose strings**
  - (Optionally) the **Application Name** using `.SetApplicationName("MyApp")`

Example:

```csharp
services.AddDataProtection()
    .SetApplicationName("ContosoApp");
```

ASP.NET Core **then builds the appropriate context headers** behind the scenes.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 7. **What Happens Without Proper Context**

If you donâ€™t set consistent purposes or application names:

- Decryption may **fail unexpectedly**.
- Data may be **invalid** when moving between different deployments or server nodes.
- **Best Practice**: Always use **explicit purpose strings** and **application names** in multi-app systems.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 8. **Context Headers vs. Key Separation**

- **Context headers**: Enforce logical separation **within** the same key ring.
- **Separate key rings**: Enforce **physical separation** (completely different keys).

Both work together to secure your app depending on how isolated you need your data to be.

# âœ… Quick Recap

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Context headers | Unencrypted metadata attached to protected payloads |
| Purpose | Bind data to app-specific or feature-specific scope |
| Application name | Optional setting for additional isolation |
| Automatic | Handled internally by Data Protection APIs |
| Importance | Prevents cross-app or cross-feature attacks |
