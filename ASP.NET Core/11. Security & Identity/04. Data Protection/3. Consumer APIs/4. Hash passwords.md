## üîê Hash Passwords in ASP.NET Core

This article explains how ASP.NET Core handles **password hashing**, why it's important, and how to implement secure password storage using the built-in APIs.

---

### üîπ 1. **Why Hash Passwords?**

- Passwords should **never be stored in plain text**.
- Hashing transforms a password into a **fixed-length, non-reversible representation**.
- Even if a database is compromised, hashed passwords add a **layer of security**.

---

### üîπ 2. **Use ASP.NET Core Identity‚Äôs `IPasswordHasher`**

- ASP.NET Core Identity uses the `IPasswordHasher<TUser>` interface.
- Default implementation: `PasswordHasher<TUser>`.

```csharp
var hasher = new PasswordHasher<ApplicationUser>();
string hashedPassword = hasher.HashPassword(user, "MySecurePassword123!");
```

---

### üîπ 3. **Verify a Hashed Password**

- Use `VerifyHashedPassword` to check if a password matches the hash.

```csharp
var result = hasher.VerifyHashedPassword(user, hashedPassword, "MySecurePassword123!");

if (result == PasswordVerificationResult.Success)
{
    // Password is correct
}
```

- Return value could also be:
    - `Failed`
    - `SuccessRehashNeeded` (means hash was valid but used an outdated format)

---

### üîπ 4. **Password Hasher Versions**

- ASP.NET Core Identity supports multiple **hashing algorithm versions**.
- Newer versions use **PBKDF2 with HMAC-SHA256**, salt, and iteration count.
- If a password hash is from an old version, you can detect that and **rehash** using the newer format.

---

### üîπ 5. **Custom Hasher Implementation**

If you want a custom password hashing strategy, implement:

```csharp
public class MyPasswordHasher : IPasswordHasher<ApplicationUser>
{
    public string HashPassword(ApplicationUser user, string password)
    {
        // Custom hash logic
    }

    public PasswordVerificationResult VerifyHashedPassword(
        ApplicationUser user, string hashedPassword, string providedPassword)
    {
        // Custom verification logic
    }
}
```

Then register your custom hasher in `Startup.cs` or `Program.cs`:

```csharp
services.AddScoped<IPasswordHasher<ApplicationUser>, MyPasswordHasher>();
```

---

### üîπ 6. **Security Considerations**

- Always use a **salt**: Random data added to each password before hashing.
- Use **key stretching algorithms** like PBKDF2 to slow down brute-force attacks.
- Don't roll your own crypto‚Äîuse established libraries/APIs like the one ASP.NET Core provides.

---

### üîπ 7. **Use in ASP.NET Core Identity**

- By default, when you use Identity (e.g., `UserManager.CreateAsync`), hashing is handled for you.

```csharp
var result = await _userManager.CreateAsync(user, "MyPassword123!");
```

- You typically don‚Äôt need to hash manually unless you're **migrating from another system** or building custom auth logic.

|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `HashPassword`                | Generates a secure, salted hash for a plain-text password           |
| `VerifyHashedPassword`        | Checks if a given password matches a previously stored hash         |
| `PasswordHasher<T>`           | Built-in implementation using PBKDF2                                |
| Hashing versions              | Allows backward compatibility with older hashes                     |
| Rehashing                     | Automatically recommended when old hash formats are detected        |
| Custom hashers                | Supported by implementing `IPasswordHasher<TUser>`                  |
