Sure! Here's a point-by-point explanation of the Microsoft Docs article **"Manage JSON Web Tokens in development with dotnet user-jwts"**, which describes how to manage development-time JWTs using the `dotnet user-jwts` tool in ASP.NET Core.

---

## 🔐 "Manage JSON Web Tokens in development with dotnet user-jwts" — Key Points

---

### 🔹 1. **What is `dotnet user-jwts`?**

- A **.NET CLI tool** that helps manage **local JWTs** for development purposes.
- Works alongside **ASP.NET Core authentication middleware**.
- Designed to simplify testing secured endpoints without a full identity server setup.

---

### 🔹 2. **Use Cases**

- Develop and test APIs that require authentication.
- Generate JWT tokens without needing an external identity provider.
- Easily simulate different users and claims.

---

### 🔹 3. **Prerequisites**

- .NET 7 or later.
- Project must include **authentication** middleware using **JWT Bearer authentication**.
- Typically added with:

```bash
dotnet new webapi --auth Individual
```

---

### 🔹 4. **Enable Support for `user-jwts`**

- The tool works with projects that:
  - Use the `"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer"` package.
  - Use `"Individual"` or `"None"` auth template options.
- Configuration must contain `Authentication:Schemes:Bearer:...` settings.

Example in `appsettings.Development.json`:

```json
"Authentication": {
  "Schemes": {
    "Bearer": {
      "ValidAudiences": [ "http://localhost" ]
    }
  }
}
```

---

### 🔹 5. **Create a JWT Token**

Generate a user JWT for your project:

```bash
dotnet user-jwts create
```

🔸 Output includes:
- Token string.
- User ID.
- Expiration date.
- File path (local storage).
- A ready-to-use `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.

---

### 🔹 6. **List JWTs**

Show all created JWTs:

```bash
dotnet user-jwts list
```

---

### 🔹 7. **Delete a JWT**

Remove a specific token:

```bash
dotnet user-jwts delete <id>
```

Or remove all:

```bash
dotnet user-jwts delete --all
```

---

### 🔹 8. **Add Custom Claims**

You can add custom claims (e.g., roles or permissions) during creation:

```bash
dotnet user-jwts create --claim role=admin --claim email=user@example.com
```

These claims are embedded in the token and used during API calls.

---

### 🔹 9. **Attach JWT in HTTP Client**

Use the generated JWT in tools like:

- **curl**:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>" https://localhost:5001/secure-endpoint
```

- **Postman / REST Client**: Add the header manually.

- **.http file in VS**:

```http
GET https://localhost:5001/secure-endpoint
Authorization: Bearer <your-token>
```

---

### 🔹 10. **Check the `Properties/` folder**

The tool stores JWT data in:

```
Properties/Identity/userSecretsId.json
```

You can safely commit this during development, but **never** in production.

---

### 🔹 11. **JWT Storage & Expiration**

- Tokens have a default **30-day** expiration.
- You can customize expiration using:

```bash
--expiration <timespan>
```

---

### 🔹 12. **Security Notes**

- This feature is **strictly for development only**.
- Tokens generated are **not secure for production**.
- Do **not expose** them outside local dev environments.
