Hereâ€™s a point-by-point breakdown of the **"Customize the behavior of AuthorizationMiddleware"** article from Microsoft Docs for ASP.NET Core:

---

## **Customize the Behavior of AuthorizationMiddleware** â€” Key Points

---

### ðŸ”¹ 1. **Overview of AuthorizationMiddleware**

- **AuthorizationMiddleware** is responsible for handling authorization requests in an ASP.NET Core application.
- It runs after the authentication middleware and ensures that the user has the necessary permissions to access the requested resource.
- By default, it checks user claims and roles against policies defined using `IAuthorizationPolicyProvider`.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 2. **Why Customize AuthorizationMiddleware?**

- **Customizing AuthorizationMiddleware** allows you to modify how authorization is applied within your application. 
- You may want to handle authorization in a more flexible way, e.g., dynamically applying authorization logic, logging authorization failures, or integrating with external services for custom policies.

Some reasons to customize:
- Implement custom logging for authorization failures.
- Introduce additional checks or constraints for authorization.
- Modify how unauthorized requests are handled.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 3. **Creating Custom Authorization Middleware**

To customize the behavior of **AuthorizationMiddleware**, you can create a custom middleware that is placed before or after the default `AuthorizationMiddleware`.

1. **Create Custom Middleware**: Define your custom middleware that modifies the request pipeline.

Example:
```csharp
public class CustomAuthorizationMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;
    private readonly ILogger<CustomAuthorizationMiddleware> _logger;

    public CustomAuthorizationMiddleware(RequestDelegate next, ILogger<CustomAuthorizationMiddleware> logger)
    {
        _next = next;
        _logger = logger;
    }

    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
    {
        // Custom authorization logic
        if (!context.User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
        {
            _logger.LogWarning("Unauthorized access attempt.");
            context.Response.StatusCode = StatusCodes.Status401Unauthorized;
            await context.Response.WriteAsync("Unauthorized access.");
            return;
        }

        await _next(context);
    }
}
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ 4. **Registering Custom Middleware**

Once your custom middleware is created, you need to **register it in the request pipeline** in `Startup.cs` or `Program.cs`.

1. In **Configure** method (for .NET 6+ in `Program.cs`):
   
```csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
    // Register the custom middleware
    app.UseMiddleware<CustomAuthorizationMiddleware>();

    // Other middleware like authentication and routing
    app.UseAuthentication();
    app.UseAuthorization();
}
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ 5. **Modifying Authorization Logic**

You can modify how **AuthorizationMiddleware** processes authorization by using custom logic, such as:
- **Authorization failures**: Define how the middleware should respond to failed authorization attempts (e.g., return custom error messages or log failures).
- **Authorization handling**: Implement conditional checks that determine if a user should be authorized, based on claims, roles, or custom logic.

Example:
```csharp
public class CustomAuthorizationMiddleware
{
    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
    {
        var user = context.User;

        // Custom logic to check claims or roles
        if (!user.HasClaim(c => c.Type == "Permission" && c.Value == "AccessDashboard"))
        {
            context.Response.StatusCode = 403; // Forbidden
            await context.Response.WriteAsync("Forbidden: You don't have permission.");
            return;
        }

        await _next(context);
    }
}
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ 6. **Using Custom Authorization Policies**

Custom policies can be applied by defining a **custom policy provider** or directly specifying them in your middleware.

Example of creating a policy and applying it dynamically:
```csharp
public class CustomAuthorizationMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;
    private readonly IAuthorizationService _authorizationService;

    public CustomAuthorizationMiddleware(RequestDelegate next, IAuthorizationService authorizationService)
    {
        _next = next;
        _authorizationService = authorizationService;
    }

    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
    {
        var authorizationResult = await _authorizationService.AuthorizeAsync(context.User, null, "CustomPolicy");

        if (!authorizationResult.Succeeded)
        {
            context.Response.StatusCode = 403; // Forbidden
            await context.Response.WriteAsync("You are not authorized to access this resource.");
            return;
        }

        await _next(context);
    }
}
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ 7. **Custom Authorization Failures**

To customize the behavior when a user is **unauthorized** or **forbidden**, you can add specific responses to handle authorization failures.

1. **Handling Unauthorized Requests**: You can customize the status code, add headers, or provide a custom message when users are unauthorized.

Example:
```csharp
public class CustomAuthorizationMiddleware
{
    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
    {
        if (!context.User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
        {
            context.Response.StatusCode = 401; // Unauthorized
            await context.Response.WriteAsync("You need to log in first.");
            return;
        }

        await _next(context);
    }
}
```

2. **Logging Failures**: Log detailed information when authorization fails, such as logging attempts or user details for auditing.

Example:
```csharp
public class CustomAuthorizationMiddleware
{
    private readonly ILogger<CustomAuthorizationMiddleware> _logger;

    public CustomAuthorizationMiddleware(ILogger<CustomAuthorizationMiddleware> logger)
    {
        _logger = logger;
    }

    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
    {
        if (!context.User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
        {
            _logger.LogWarning($"Unauthorized access attempt at {context.Request.Path}");
            context.Response.StatusCode = 401; // Unauthorized
            await context.Response.WriteAsync("Unauthorized access.");
            return;
        }

        await _next(context);
    }
}
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ 8. **Handling Authorization for Specific Paths**

You can also **customize the middleware** to handle authorization for specific endpoints or URL paths by checking the request path and applying different logic.

Example:
```csharp
public class CustomAuthorizationMiddleware
{
    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
    {
        if (context.Request.Path.StartsWithSegments("/admin"))
        {
            if (!context.User.IsInRole("Admin"))
            {
                context.Response.StatusCode = 403; // Forbidden
                await context.Response.WriteAsync("Forbidden: Admins only.");
                return;
            }
        }

        await _next(context);
    }
}
```

### ðŸ”¹ 9. **Performance Considerations**

- **Avoid Redundant Authorization Checks**: Donâ€™t repeatedly check the same authorization conditions for each request. Consider caching authorization results where necessary to optimize performance.
- **Keep Logic Lightweight**: Authorization checks should be fast to ensure they don't block the request pipeline unnecessarily.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 10. **Alternative Custom Authorization Handlers**

While customizing **AuthorizationMiddleware** is one way to handle authorization, another approach involves using custom **AuthorizationHandlers** in conjunction with ASP.NET Coreâ€™s policy-based authorization.
