Hereâ€™s a point-by-point breakdown of the article **"Dependency Injection in Requirement Handlers in ASP.NET Core"** from Microsoft Docs:

## ðŸ§© **Dependency Injection in Requirement Handlers in ASP.NET Core**

---

### ðŸ”¹ 1. **Overview**

- ASP.NET Core supports **dependency injection (DI)**, allowing services to be injected into classes at runtime.
- **Authorization handlers** can leverage DI to access services like logging, repositories, or external APIs.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 2. **Creating a Custom Authorization Handler**

- Implement the `AuthorizationHandler<TRequirement>` class, where `TRequirement` is your custom requirement.
- Inject dependencies through the constructor.

Example:

```csharp
public class SampleAuthorizationHandler : AuthorizationHandler<SampleRequirement>
{
    private readonly ILogger _logger;

    public SampleAuthorizationHandler(ILoggerFactory loggerFactory)
        => _logger = loggerFactory.CreateLogger(GetType().FullName);

    protected override Task HandleRequirementAsync(
        AuthorizationHandlerContext context, SampleRequirement requirement)
    {
        _logger.LogInformation("Inside my handler");

        // Authorization logic

        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ 3. **Registering the Handler with DI**

- Register the handler in the DI container during application startup.

Example:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddSingleton<IAuthorizationHandler, SampleAuthorizationHandler>();
```

- The DI container resolves and injects the required services into the handler's constructor.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 4. **Service Lifetimes**

- Choose the appropriate service lifetime:
  - **Singleton**: For stateless services.
  - **Scoped**: For services that depend on a scoped context (e.g., Entity Framework).
  - **Transient**: For lightweight, short-lived services.

**Note**: Avoid registering handlers that use **Entity Framework** as singletons due to potential issues with scoped services.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 5. **Using Injected Services**

- Once registered, the handler can use the injected services to perform authorization logic.
- For example, you can inject a repository to check user permissions or roles.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 6. **Best Practices**

- Ensure that handlers are **stateless** to prevent unintended behavior.
- Use appropriate service lifetimes to manage dependencies effectively.
- Avoid injecting services that are not thread-safe into singleton handlers.
