Here's a breakdown of the article **"View-based Authorization in ASP.NET Core MVC"** based on what I can infer:

---

## ðŸ‘€ **View-Based Authorization in ASP.NET Core MVC**

---

### ðŸ”¹ 1. **Overview**

- View-based authorization in ASP.NET Core MVC is a technique to **show or hide UI elements** (like buttons, links, or menus) based on the **authorization status** of the user.
- It allows developers to **control access to views** and **display specific UI elements** to users based on their roles, claims, or other authorization policies.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 2. **When to Use View-Based Authorization**

- It is particularly useful when you need to:
  - **Show or hide UI elements** based on the userâ€™s authorization status.
  - **Conditionally render parts of views** without restricting access to entire pages.
  
---

### ðŸ”¹ 3. **Implementing View-Based Authorization in MVC**

- You can use **Razor views** combined with authorization logic to control access to specific parts of the page.
  
#### Example:
To conditionally display a button or a menu based on the userâ€™s role:

```html
@using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization

@if (User.IsInRole("Admin"))
{
    <button>Admin Only Action</button>
}
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ 4. **Using Authorization Tags**

- **ASP.NET Core MVC** provides helper methods like `@User.IsInRole`, `@User.HasClaim`, or custom authorization policies to control whether a user can view certain elements in the view.
  
Example with `AuthorizeView`:

```html
<authorizeview>
  <authorized>
    <button>Only authorized users can see this button</button>
  </authorized>
  <notauthorized>
    <p>You must be logged in to see this.</p>
  </notauthorized>
</authorizeview>
```

This allows **dynamic rendering** based on the authentication status or authorization requirements.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 5. **Using Policies for Fine-Grained Control**

- If you have more complex requirements, you can use **authorization policies** to control which parts of the UI a user can access.

Example:

```html
@using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization

@{ 
    var result = await AuthorizationService.AuthorizeAsync(User, "CanViewPagePolicy");
}

@if (result.Succeeded)
{
    <div>Page content visible to authorized users only.</div>
}
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ 6. **Role-based Authorization in Views**

- **Role-based authorization** can be used to conditionally show UI elements based on the userâ€™s role.
  
Example:

```html
@{
    if (User.IsInRole("Administrator"))
    {
        <a href="/admin">Admin Section</a>
    }
    else
    {
        <p>You do not have access to the admin section.</p>
    }
}
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ 7. **Using Claims for View-Based Authorization**

- **Claims-based authorization** can also be used in views to display content based on specific user claims.

Example:

```html
@{
    if (User.HasClaim(c => c.Type == "Subscription" && c.Value == "Premium"))
    {
        <p>Premium content</p>
    }
}
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ 8. **Best Practices**

- **Avoid exposing sensitive data**: View-based authorization should primarily control UI visibility, but sensitive data should still be protected by backend authorization checks.
- Use **authorization policies** for more complex authorization requirements and avoid checking authorization directly within Razor views.
  
---

### ðŸ”¹ 9. **Conclusion**

- View-based authorization offers a flexible way to tailor the user experience based on their access rights.
- It enables developers to show or hide UI elements dynamically, based on the roles, claims, or custom authorization policies that the user has.

This method helps in **fine-grained access control** and improves the security and user experience of your web application. Let me know if you'd like more details on any specific part!
