Here’s a **point-by-point explanation** of the Microsoft Docs article **"Share authentication cookies among ASP.NET apps"** for ASP.NET Core:

# 🍪 Share Authentication Cookies Among ASP.NET Apps – Explained by Points

---

## 1. **Why Share Authentication Cookies?**

- **Single Sign-On (SSO)** across multiple ASP.NET (or ASP.NET Core) apps.
- When users **sign in to one app**, they are **automatically authenticated** in others.
- Useful for:
  - Microservices
  - Different web apps in the same organization
  - Seamless user experience

---

## 2. **Supported Scenarios**

- ASP.NET Core apps can share cookies **with each other**.
- ASP.NET Core apps can also **share cookies with classic ASP.NET 4.x apps**, but extra configuration is needed (e.g., compatible data protection settings).

---

## 3. **How Cookie Authentication Works**

ASP.NET Core uses **Cookie Authentication** middleware:

- Signs in the user.
- Creates an encrypted cookie with identity information.
- Validates the cookie on future requests.

To **share cookies**, multiple apps must:
- Use the **same cookie settings**.
- Use the **same encryption keys** (data protection).

---

## 4. **Steps to Share Authentication Cookies (ASP.NET Core to ASP.NET Core)**

---

### 4.1. **Set the Same Cookie Name**

In each app, configure the **same cookie name**:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddAuthentication(CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
    .AddCookie(options =>
    {
        options.Cookie.Name = ".AspNet.SharedCookie";
    });
```

✅ Ensures the browser sends the cookie to both apps.

---

### 4.2. **Use a Shared Data Protection Key**

Authentication cookies are **encrypted**.
To decrypt cookies between apps, configure a **shared key storage**:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddDataProtection()
    .PersistKeysToFileSystem(new DirectoryInfo(@"\\server\share\keys\"))
    .SetApplicationName("SharedCookieApp");
```

✅ All apps must use:
- The **same key location**
- The **same application name**

---

### 4.3. **Set the Same Cookie Domain**

If apps are on **different subdomains** (e.g., `app1.example.com`, `app2.example.com`):

```csharp
options.Cookie.Domain = ".example.com";
```

✅ This allows the cookie to be shared across subdomains.

---

## 5. **Sharing Cookies Between ASP.NET Core and ASP.NET 4.x**

More complicated:
- ASP.NET 4.x uses **MachineKey** for encryption.
- ASP.NET Core uses **Data Protection API**.

You need to **configure Data Protection** in ASP.NET Core to be **compatible** with ASP.NET 4.x:
- Set the `DataProtectionProvider` to mimic MachineKey settings.
- Use `Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection` extensions.

Example configuration:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddDataProtection()
    .ProtectKeysWithDpapi()
    .SetApplicationName("SharedCookieApp")
    .UseCryptographicAlgorithms(new AuthenticatedEncryptorConfiguration
    {
        EncryptionAlgorithm = EncryptionAlgorithm.AES_256_CBC,
        ValidationAlgorithm = ValidationAlgorithm.HMACSHA256
    });
```

✅ Ensures encryption matches legacy ASP.NET settings.

---

## 6. **Important Settings Summary**

| Setting | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Cookie Name | Must match in all apps |
| Application Name | Must match in all apps |
| Data Protection Keys | Must be shared among apps |
| Cookie Domain | Needed for sharing across subdomains |
| Encryption Algorithms (ASP.NET 4.x) | Must match between frameworks |

---

## 7. **Typical Folder Structure for Keys**

You can store keys:
- On a **network share** (`\\server\share\keys`)
- On **Azure Blob Storage** (for cloud apps)
- In a **database** (with custom providers)

Example for filesystem:

```
/SharedKeys/
    - key-2024-04-29.xml
    - key-2024-05-29.xml
```

✅ All apps must read/write to the same folder.

---

## 8. **Security Tips**

- **Protect your keys** — use encryption at rest.
- **Secure the network share** if storing keys on a file server.
- **Use HTTPS** to transmit cookies securely.
- **Set `Cookie.SecurePolicy`** to enforce sending cookies only over HTTPS.

Example:

```csharp
options.Cookie.SecurePolicy = CookieSecurePolicy.Always;
```

---

# ✅ Quick Full Example (Program.cs for ASP.NET Core App)

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Services.AddDataProtection()
    .PersistKeysToFileSystem(new DirectoryInfo(@"\\server\share\keys\"))
    .SetApplicationName("SharedCookieApp");

builder.Services.AddAuthentication(CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
    .AddCookie(options =>
    {
        options.Cookie.Name = ".AspNet.SharedCookie";
        options.Cookie.Domain = ".example.com";
        options.Cookie.SecurePolicy = CookieSecurePolicy.Always;
    });

var app = builder.Build();

app.UseAuthentication();
app.UseAuthorization();

app.MapControllers();

app.Run();
```

---

# ✨ Final Thoughts

- Sharing cookies is **simple between ASP.NET Core apps**.
- Sharing between **ASP.NET 4.x and Core** requires **encryption compatibility settings**.
- Always **protect your keys** and **enforce HTTPS**.
