Certainly! Let's go through the next three subpoints of the "Make HTTP requests using IHttpClientFactory in ASP.NET Core" article:

### 1. HttpClient and Lifetime Management

#### Overview:
Managing the lifetime of `HttpClient` instances is crucial to ensure efficient use of system resources and prevent issues like socket exhaustion. `IHttpClientFactory` helps manage `HttpClient` lifetimes by creating and sharing `HttpClient` instances appropriately.

#### Key Points:
- **Singleton Issues:** Using a single `HttpClient` instance for the lifetime of an application can cause DNS changes to be ignored.
- **Instance Per Request Issues:** Creating a new `HttpClient` instance for each request can lead to socket exhaustion.
- **Solution with IHttpClientFactory:** `IHttpClientFactory` provides a way to create `HttpClient` instances with proper lifetime management, by reusing `HttpMessageHandler` instances when possible.

#### Example:
Using `IHttpClientFactory` to manage lifetimes:
```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddHttpClient();
}

public class MyService
{
    private readonly IHttpClientFactory _clientFactory;

    public MyService(IHttpClientFactory clientFactory)
    {
        _clientFactory = clientFactory;
    }

    public async Task<string> GetDataAsync()
    {
        var client = _clientFactory.CreateClient();
        var response = await client.GetAsync("https://api.example.com/data");
        response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
        return await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
    }
}
```

### 2. Logging

#### Overview:
Logging is an essential aspect of monitoring and debugging HTTP requests made using `HttpClient`. `IHttpClientFactory` integrates with ASP.NET Core's logging infrastructure to provide detailed logs of HTTP requests and responses.

#### Key Points:
- **Automatic Logging:** `IHttpClientFactory` automatically logs information about HTTP requests and responses.
- **Custom Logging:** You can create custom logging handlers to log additional information or customize the logging behavior.
- **Log Levels:** Depending on the configured log levels, different levels of detail can be captured (e.g., Information, Warning, Error).

#### Example:
Enabling logging for HTTP requests:
```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddHttpClient();
    services.AddLogging(config =>
    {
        config.AddConsole();
        config.AddDebug();
    });
}

public class MyService
{
    private readonly IHttpClientFactory _clientFactory;
    private readonly ILogger<MyService> _logger;

    public MyService(IHttpClientFactory clientFactory, ILogger<MyService> logger)
    {
        _clientFactory = clientFactory;
        _logger = logger;
    }

    public async Task<string> GetDataAsync()
    {
        var client = _clientFactory.CreateClient();
        _logger.LogInformation("Sending request to https://api.example.com/data");
        var response = await client.GetAsync("https://api.example.com/data");
        _logger.LogInformation("Received response: {StatusCode}", response.StatusCode);
        response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
        return await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
    }
}
```

### 3. Configure the HttpMessageHandler

#### Overview:
The `HttpMessageHandler` pipeline is responsible for processing HTTP requests and responses. Configuring `HttpMessageHandler` allows for customizing the behavior of `HttpClient`, such as setting up authentication, handling redirects, or applying custom policies.

#### Key Points:
- **Primary Handler:** Configure the primary `HttpMessageHandler`, such as `HttpClientHandler`, used for the HTTP requests.
- **Delegating Handlers:** Add custom delegating handlers to the pipeline to implement cross-cutting concerns like logging, retries, caching, etc.
- **Configuration:** Use the `ConfigurePrimaryHttpMessageHandler` and `AddHttpMessageHandler` methods to configure handlers.

#### Example:
Configuring a primary handler and adding a custom delegating handler:
```csharp
public class LoggingHandler : DelegatingHandler
{
    private readonly ILogger<LoggingHandler> _logger;

    public LoggingHandler(ILogger<LoggingHandler> logger)
    {
        _logger = logger;
    }

    protected override async Task<HttpResponseMessage> SendAsync(HttpRequestMessage request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        _logger.LogInformation("Sending request: {RequestUri}", request.RequestUri);
        var response = await base.SendAsync(request, cancellationToken);
        _logger.LogInformation("Received response: {StatusCode}", response.StatusCode);
        return response;
    }
}

public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddTransient<LoggingHandler>();

    services.AddHttpClient("MyNamedClient")
            .ConfigurePrimaryHttpMessageHandler(() =>
            {
                return new HttpClientHandler
                {
                    UseCookies = false
                };
            })
            .AddHttpMessageHandler<LoggingHandler>();
}

public class MyService
{
    private readonly IHttpClientFactory _clientFactory;

    public MyService(IHttpClientFactory clientFactory)
    {
        _clientFactory = clientFactory;
    }

    public async Task<string> GetDataAsync()
    {
        var client = _clientFactory.CreateClient("MyNamedClient");
        var response = await client.GetAsync("/data");
        response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
        return await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
    }
}
```

### Summary:

These subpoints cover important aspects of using `IHttpClientFactory` in ASP.NET Core. Proper lifetime management of `HttpClient` instances avoids common issues like socket exhaustion and DNS changes. Logging is integrated with the ASP.NET Core logging infrastructure to provide detailed information about HTTP requests and responses. Configuring `HttpMessageHandler` allows for customization of the HTTP request pipeline, enabling the implementation of cross-cutting concerns such as logging and retry policies.
