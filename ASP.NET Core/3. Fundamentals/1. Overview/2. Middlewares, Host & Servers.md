### **Middleware in ASP.NET Core**

In ASP.NET Core, the **middleware** is a series of components that handle HTTP requests and responses. Middleware components are executed in the order in which they are added to the pipeline, and each component has the ability to:

- **Process the request**.
- **Invoke the next middleware** in the pipeline.
- **Terminate the request** (i.e., sending the response directly without invoking further middleware).

### **How Middleware Works**
The middleware pipeline is established by chaining **middleware components**, each performing specific tasks such as authentication, logging, exception handling, or even modifying the response.

A typical middleware component can either:
1. **Process the request** (e.g., log details about the request).
2. **Pass control to the next middleware** (if any).
3. **Terminate the request** (for example, sending a response if an error is detected, without continuing the pipeline).

Middleware components are added to the app using extension methods named `Use{Feature}`, such as `UseExceptionHandler`, `UseHttpsRedirection`, and others.

### **Example of Middleware in Program.cs**
```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Add services to the container.
builder.Services.AddDbContextFactory<BlazorWebAppMoviesContext>(options =>
    options.UseSqlServer(builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("MoviesContext")
        ?? throw new InvalidOperationException("Connection string not found.")));

// Configure the HTTP request pipeline.
var app = builder.Build();

if (!app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
{
    app.UseExceptionHandler("/Error"); // Middleware for error handling
    app.UseHsts(); // HTTP Strict Transport Security
    app.UseMigrationsEndPoint(); // Middleware to run migrations
}

app.UseHttpsRedirection(); // Middleware to redirect HTTP to HTTPS
app.UseAntiforgery(); // Middleware to handle anti-forgery tokens

app.MapStaticAssets(); // Middleware for static files (e.g., images, CSS, JS)
app.MapRazorComponents<App>().AddInteractiveServerRenderMode(); // Blazor components middleware

app.Run(); // Run the app
```

### **Common Middleware Types:**
- **Exception Handling**: `UseExceptionHandler("/Error")` catches errors and redirects to an error page.
- **HTTPS Redirection**: `UseHttpsRedirection()` forces the app to redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS.
- **Static File Handling**: `UseStaticFiles()` serves static assets like CSS, JavaScript, and images.
- **Authorization**: `UseAuthorization()` ensures that only authorized users can access certain resources.
- **CORS**: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing can be enabled to allow or restrict resources to be accessed from other domains.

### **The Host in ASP.NET Core**

The **host** in ASP.NET Core is responsible for managing app resources such as:
- **HTTP server implementation** (e.g., Kestrel).
- **Middleware components**.
- **Logging**.
- **Dependency Injection (DI)** services.
- **Configuration**.

The **WebApplication** host is used to run ASP.NET Core applications and is typically preferred in modern apps because of its simplicity. It combines multiple components of the app (server, DI, etc.) with fewer configuration steps compared to older hosting methods.

### **Creating the Host in ASP.NET Core:**

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Add services to the container.
builder.Services.AddRazorPages();
builder.Services.AddControllersWithViews();

var app = builder.Build();

// Configure the HTTP request pipeline.
app.UseRouting(); // Middleware for routing requests to endpoints
app.MapRazorPages(); // Map Razor Pages to endpoints
app.Run(); // Run the app
```

The `WebApplication.CreateBuilder` method sets up the host and automatically configures default options like using **Kestrel** as the web server, loading configuration settings, and providing logging.

### **Servers in ASP.NET Core**

An ASP.NET Core app can run on various web server implementations. The **server** is responsible for handling HTTP requests and sending them to the app for processing.

ASP.NET Core supports the following servers:

1. **Kestrel**: A cross-platform web server that is the default for ASP.NET Core. It can be used behind a reverse proxy like IIS or Nginx, or it can be exposed directly to the internet.
2. **IIS HTTP Server**: Used on Windows and integrates with IIS. The ASP.NET Core app runs as a child process of IIS.
3. **HTTP.sys**: A web server for Windows that doesnâ€™t require IIS. It can be used to host ASP.NET Core applications in scenarios where IIS isn't available.

### **Example of Configuring Kestrel with the Host:**
```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Configure Kestrel server
builder.WebHost.ConfigureKestrel(serverOptions =>
{
    serverOptions.Listen(IPAddress.Any, 5000); // Configure the server to listen on port 5000
});

var app = builder.Build();
app.Run();
```

### **Summary**
- **Middleware**: Components that process HTTP requests and responses. They are added to the pipeline using `Use{Feature}` extension methods.
- **Host**: Encapsulates the app's resources such as the HTTP server, middleware, logging, and DI.
- **Servers**: ASP.NET Core uses **Kestrel**, **IIS**, and **HTTP.sys** for hosting the app and handling HTTP requests.

These components are integral for configuring and running an ASP.NET Core application, providing the infrastructure and tools for request processing, server communication, and resource management.
