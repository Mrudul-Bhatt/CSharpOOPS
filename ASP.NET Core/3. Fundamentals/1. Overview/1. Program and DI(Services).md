### **ASP.NET Core Fundamentals Overview**

ASP.NET Core is a modern, high-performance web framework used to build web applications and APIs. This overview focuses on several fundamental concepts that developers use to create ASP.NET Core apps, including **Dependency Injection (DI)**, **configuration**, **middleware**, and more.

#### **Program.cs File**

In ASP.NET Core, the **Program.cs** file contains the application startup code. It is where the app’s services are configured and the middleware pipeline is defined. This file helps set up:

- Services required by the app.
- The HTTP request handling pipeline, which involves defining middleware components.

Here’s an example of the `Program.cs` file in an ASP.NET Core application:

```csharp
using WebAll.Components;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Add services to the container.
builder.Services.AddRazorComponents()
    .AddInteractiveServerComponents();
builder.Services.AddRazorPages();
builder.Services.AddControllersWithViews();

var app = builder.Build();

// Configure the HTTP request pipeline.
if (!app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
{
    app.UseExceptionHandler("/Error");
    app.UseHsts();
}

app.UseHttpsRedirection();
app.UseStaticFiles();
app.UseAuthorization();

app.MapGet("/hi", () => "Hello!");
app.MapDefaultControllerRoute();
app.MapRazorPages();
app.MapRazorComponents<App>()
    .AddInteractiveServerRenderMode();

app.UseAntiforgery();

app.Run();
```

This code configures the app to use **Razor Pages**, **MVC**, **Blazor**, and more. It defines middleware such as exception handling and static file serving.

### **Dependency Injection (DI) in ASP.NET Core**

ASP.NET Core has built-in **Dependency Injection (DI)**, which allows services to be registered and made available throughout the application. DI simplifies managing dependencies like databases, services, and configuration settings.

1. **Registering Services in DI Container**: Services are registered using the `builder.Services` collection, which is part of the `WebApplicationBuilder` object. ASP.NET Core automatically adds many essential services (e.g., configuration, logging, etc.) to the DI container when `CreateBuilder` is called.

   Example:
   ```csharp
   var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

   // Register services in DI
   builder.Services.AddRazorPages();
   builder.Services.AddControllersWithViews();
   builder.Services.AddDbContext<MyDbContext>(options =>
       options.UseSqlServer("ConnectionString"));
   ```

2. **Resolving Services from DI**: Services are injected into components or controllers using constructor injection or the `@inject` directive in Razor components.

   **Constructor Injection Example**:
   ```csharp
   public class IndexModel : PageModel
   {
       private readonly MyDbContext _context;
       private readonly ILogger<IndexModel> _logger;

       public IndexModel(MyDbContext context, ILogger<IndexModel> logger)
       {
           _context = context;
           _logger = logger;
       }

       public IList<Movie> Movies { get; set; }

       public async Task OnGetAsync()
       {
           _logger.LogInformation("OnGetAsync executed.");
           Movies = await _context.Movies.ToListAsync();
       }
   }
   ```

   **@inject in Blazor Components Example**:
   ```razor
   @page "/movies"
   @inject IDbContextFactory<MyDbContext> DbFactory

   @code {
       private MyDbContext _context;

       protected override void OnInitialized()
       {
           _context = DbFactory.CreateDbContext();
       }
   }
   ```

   In this example, the `@inject` directive allows the Blazor component to resolve the `IDbContextFactory` and obtain the database context.

### **Core Concepts in ASP.NET Core**

1. **Configuration**: ASP.NET Core has a **configuration system** that allows you to access app settings, such as those in `appsettings.json`, environment variables, and command-line arguments. This system is highly flexible and works well with different deployment environments (e.g., development, production).

2. **Middleware**: Middleware in ASP.NET Core is a pipeline of components that handle HTTP requests. Middleware components can be added to the pipeline in the `Program.cs` file using methods like `app.UseExceptionHandler()`, `app.UseStaticFiles()`, and `app.UseAuthorization()`. Each middleware performs a specific task, such as authentication, logging, or response compression.

   Example middleware usage:
   ```csharp
   if (!app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
   {
       app.UseExceptionHandler("/Error");
       app.UseHsts();
   }

   app.UseHttpsRedirection();
   app.UseStaticFiles();
   ```

3. **Routing and Endpoints**: ASP.NET Core allows you to define HTTP request routes using methods like `MapGet()`, `MapPost()`, or `MapControllerRoute()`. This routing system allows you to map incoming requests to specific handler methods (e.g., controllers or Razor Pages).

   Example:
   ```csharp
   app.MapGet("/hi", () => "Hello!");
   app.MapDefaultControllerRoute();
   ```

4. **Blazor Components**: ASP.NET Core also supports **Blazor**, a framework that allows you to build interactive web UIs using **C#** instead of JavaScript. The `@inject` directive is commonly used in Blazor components to inject services at runtime.

### **Summary**

ASP.NET Core provides a flexible and powerful framework for building modern web applications. Some of its key features include:

- **Dependency Injection (DI)** for managing services.
- **Middleware** to handle HTTP requests and responses.
- **Configuration** system for flexible settings management.
- **Routing** to map HTTP requests to endpoints.
- **Support for Blazor** to create interactive web UIs with C#.

By using these features, developers can build scalable, maintainable, and cross-platform web applications.
