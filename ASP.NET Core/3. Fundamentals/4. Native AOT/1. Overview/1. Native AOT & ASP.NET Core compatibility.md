### **ASP.NET Core Support for Native AOT**

.NET Native **Ahead-of-Time (AOT)** compilation is a feature introduced in **ASP.NET Core 8.0** that compiles an application ahead of time into a native executable. This approach offers several benefits in terms of performance, deployment, and resource management, but it also comes with some compatibility limitations.

### **Why Use Native AOT with ASP.NET Core?**

When publishing and deploying a Native AOT app, there are multiple benefits:

1. **Minimized Disk Footprint**:
   - Native AOT produces a **single executable** that only includes the code from external dependencies required to support the application. This results in:
     - **Smaller container images**, which is crucial in containerized environments.
     - **Faster deployment times** due to smaller image sizes.
     - **Reduced executable size** when compared to a traditional app.

2. **Reduced Startup Time**:
   - Native AOT applications often exhibit faster startup times because they don't need to rely on Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation at runtime. This leads to:
     - **Faster response times** as the application is ready to service requests quicker.
     - **Better deployment for container orchestrators**, making transitions from one version of the app to another more efficient.

3. **Reduced Memory Demand**:
   - Native AOT applications can consume **less memory**, which allows for:
     - **Greater deployment density**, as more apps can run on the same infrastructure.
     - **Improved scalability**, as the memory footprint is lower.

Benchmarking tests have shown that Native AOT apps have lower:
- **App size**
- **Memory usage**
- **Startup time**

#### **Key Points on Compatibility**:
- **Fully Supported Features**: These features are fully compatible with Native AOT and should work as expected.
- **Partially Supported Features**: These features may have some limitations or require specific configurations.
- **Not Supported Features**: These features cannot be used with Native AOT deployments as they rely on runtime compilation or specific features that AOT does not support.

### **Testing and Limitations**

Before migrating to Native AOT, it’s crucial to thoroughly test the application to ensure that the behavior and functionality are preserved after the deployment.

1. **Native AOT Warnings**:
   - During the build process, if Native AOT warnings are generated, they must be addressed, as they indicate potential issues that could prevent the application from working as intended.
   - An application with **no AOT warnings** at build time is expected to function the same way as an untrimmed JIT-compiled app.

2. **Known Issues and Limitations**:
   - Native AOT may have compatibility issues, particularly with certain dynamic features of .NET, such as reflection or code generation.
   - **Trimming warnings** and **AOT-specific issues** should be reviewed, and developers should be aware of any potential risks when using AOT in production.

3. **Publishing with Native AOT**:
   - When publishing with Native AOT, the application is compiled ahead of time, meaning that parts of the code that are not required are excluded, reducing the size and memory usage. However, not all ASP.NET Core features support this type of optimization.

### **Conclusion**

Native AOT in **ASP.NET Core 8.0** offers significant advantages in terms of deployment efficiency, reduced resource usage, and faster startup times. However, it is not compatible with all features in ASP.NET Core. Developers should test applications thoroughly when migrating to Native AOT to ensure that no unexpected behaviors arise due to the trimming or absence of certain runtime features. Native AOT works best for scenarios where smaller executable sizes, faster startup times, and reduced memory usage are critical, such as containerized applications and microservices.
