### **Native AOT Publishing in ASP.NET Core**

Native AOT (Ahead-of-Time) compilation is a feature introduced in **.NET 8** that enables developers to compile .NET applications into native code ahead of time, providing benefits like reduced application size, improved startup performance, and minimized memory consumption. To use Native AOT in an ASP.NET Core project, it must be enabled in the project file.

---

### **Enabling Native AOT Publishing**

To enable Native AOT, the `PublishAot` MSBuild property is used in the project file. Here's how to do it:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <PublishAot>true</PublishAot>
</PropertyGroup>
```

This setting activates **Native AOT compilation** during the publish process and enables **dynamic code usage analysis** during both build and editing. When publishing, Native AOT compiles the application ahead of time, whereas the application will still use JIT (Just-In-Time) compilation during local execution.

---

### **Key Differences Between AOT and JIT-Compiled Apps**

1. **Feature Compatibility**:
   - Features that aren't compatible with Native AOT are **disabled** and may **throw runtime exceptions**. 
   
2. **Source Analyzer**:
   - Native AOT includes a **source analyzer** that highlights code incompatible with Native AOT. During publishing, the app and its **NuGet packages** are analyzed for compatibility.
   - If issues are found, **Native AOT warnings** are shown, and developers should take corrective steps.

3. **Frequent Publishing**:
   - It’s recommended to **publish frequently** during development to catch potential issues early and ensure compatibility with Native AOT.

### **Supported ASP.NET Core App Types for Native AOT in .NET 8**

In **.NET 8**, Native AOT is supported for the following ASP.NET Core app types:

- **Minimal APIs**: The Native AOT template for Web APIs uses minimal APIs since MVC isn't yet supported with Native AOT.
- **gRPC**: Native AOT is compatible with gRPC APIs.
- **Worker Services**: Worker services also support Native AOT deployment.

For more detailed guidance, developers can refer to specific sections on **gRPC** and **Worker Services** for Native AOT.

### **Web API (Native AOT) Template**

The **Web API (Native AOT)** template (`webapiaot`) is designed to create projects with Native AOT enabled. Here are the notable differences from the regular Web API template:

1. **Uses Minimal APIs**:
   - Native AOT projects must use minimal APIs because **MVC is not compatible** with Native AOT yet.

2. **Slimmed-down Builder**:
   - The project template uses `CreateSlimBuilder()`, which ensures that only essential features are enabled by default. This helps minimize the app’s deployed size.
   
3. **HTTP Only**:
   - The template configures the app to listen on **HTTP only**. This is because **HTTPS traffic** is often handled by a cloud-native ingress service (e.g., in Kubernetes environments).

4. **No IIS Integration**:
   - Unlike regular Web API templates, this template doesn't include a launch profile for IIS or IIS Express. 

5. **Sample Application**:
   - Instead of the typical weather forecast example, the template includes a sample **Todo API**.

6. **Enable JSON Serialization Source Generators**:
   - This template enables **JSON serialization source generators**, which are essential for Native AOT. Without source generation, the default **reflection-based serialization** won’t work in Native AOT, as reflection is unsupported in this model.

---

### **Supporting Code for JSON Serialization in Native AOT**

To support **JSON serialization** in Native AOT, source generators are used to generate serialization code at build time, replacing the need for reflection at runtime. Here’s an example of the code added to **Program.cs** to support JSON serialization:

```csharp
using MyFirstAotWebApi;
using System.Text.Json.Serialization;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateSlimBuilder(args);

builder.Services.ConfigureHttpJsonOptions(options =>
{
    options.SerializerOptions.TypeInfoResolverChain.Insert(0, AppJsonSerializerContext.Default);
});

var app = builder.Build();

var sampleTodos = TodoGenerator.GenerateTodos().ToArray();

var todosApi = app.MapGroup("/todos");
todosApi.MapGet("/", () => sampleTodos);
todosApi.MapGet("/{id}", (int id) =>
    sampleTodos.FirstOrDefault(a => a.Id == id) is { } todo
        ? Results.Ok(todo)
        : Results.NotFound());

app.Run();

[JsonSerializable(typeof(Todo[]))]
internal partial class AppJsonSerializerContext : JsonSerializerContext
{
}
```

In this code:
- **JSON source generators** are used to serialize and deserialize the `Todo[]` array. 
- The `CreateSlimBuilder()` method is used to initialize a lightweight builder for the app with minimal features, which is beneficial for both trimming and AOT compilation.

### **Changes to `launchSettings.json`**

In the **Web API (Native AOT)** template, the `launchSettings.json` file has been modified as follows:
- The **IIS Express profile** and `iisSettings` section are removed, as IIS support is not needed for Native AOT apps.
- The HTTP profile is updated to launch the app using HTTP only.

Here is a sample change to the `launchSettings.json`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "http://json.schemastore.org/launchsettings.json",
  "profiles": {
    "http": {
      "commandName": "Project",
      "dotnetRunMessages": true,
      "launchBrowser": true,
      "launchUrl": "todos",
      "applicationUrl": "http://localhost:5102",
      "environmentVariables": {
        "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### **The `CreateSlimBuilder()` Method**

The `CreateSlimBuilder()` method initializes the `WebApplicationBuilder` with only the **minimal features** necessary to run an app, which is perfect for **Native AOT** deployment.

Key points about `CreateSlimBuilder()`:
- **Minimal Configuration**: It provides essential configurations like JSON file configuration, user secrets, and console logging, but excludes advanced features like **HTTPS**, **IIS integration**, and **Kestrel configuration**.
- **Doesn't Support**: Features such as **Hosting startup assemblies**, **UseStartup**, **IIS integration**, and **HTTPS in Kestrel** are not available.
- **Optimized for Trimming**: This method is designed to be **trimmable** and efficient for AOT compilation.

For more advanced scenarios where you need more features (like Kestrel configuration or static files), use `CreateBuilder()` instead of `CreateSlimBuilder()`.

### **Conclusion**

Native AOT publishing in ASP.NET Core provides significant benefits for reducing application size, memory usage, and improving startup time. To enable Native AOT, developers simply set the `PublishAot` property in the project file. The **Web API (Native AOT)** template helps create AOT-optimized applications by using **minimal APIs** and **source generators** for JSON serialization. Developers must also be aware of the limited support for certain features in Native AOT and ensure their apps are thoroughly tested to handle compatibility issues.
