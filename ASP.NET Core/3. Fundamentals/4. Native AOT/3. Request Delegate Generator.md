### **Turn Map Methods into Request Delegates with the ASP.NET Core Request Delegate Generator (RDG)**

The **Request Delegate Generator (RDG)** is a **compile-time source generator** introduced in ASP.NET Core 8.0 that optimizes the way minimal APIs are handled. It automatically converts **Map methods** (such as `MapGet`, `MapPost`, `MapPut`, etc.) into **RequestDelegates**, which are processed by ASP.NET Core's routing infrastructure.

Here’s an explanation of how it works and how it affects performance and functionality, especially when publishing with **Native AOT** or enabling **trimming**.

### **How RDG Works**

The RDG is responsible for turning the **Map methods** into request delegates that are tied to specific routes. For example, methods like `MapGet`, `MapPost`, `MapPut`, `MapDelete`, etc., define HTTP request handlers. These methods allow developers to create **Minimal APIs** in ASP.NET Core quickly and concisely.

### **Behavior of RDG**

#### **When Publishing with Native AOT or Trimming Enabled:**
- **Compile-time behavior:** If **Native AOT** or **trimming** is enabled, the RDG generates request delegates at **build-time** (when the app is published).
  - The **Map methods** are converted to `RequestDelegate` and compiled into the app's **native image**.
  - This eliminates the need for these delegates to be generated at **runtime**, improving app performance by reducing startup time.
  - The app code is **statically analyzable** by the Native AOT toolchain to ensure that the necessary types and code aren't trimmed away.

#### **When Native AOT is Not Enabled:**
- **Runtime behavior:** If **Native AOT** and **trimming** are not enabled, the **Map methods** are still compiled into request delegates, but the generation occurs **at runtime** when the app starts.
  - The request delegates are created when the app starts up, which may have a slightly slower startup time compared to when Native AOT is enabled.

### **Automatic and Manual Enablement of RDG**

- The RDG is **automatically enabled** in projects when either **Native AOT** or **trimming** is enabled.
- It can also be **manually enabled** in your project file by adding the `<EnableRequestDelegateGenerator>` property:

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
    <Nullable>enable</Nullable>
    <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>
    <EnableRequestDelegateGenerator>true</EnableRequestDelegateGenerator>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```

Manually enabling RDG is particularly useful for:
1. **Evaluating compatibility** with Native AOT.
2. **Improving startup performance** by pregenerating request delegates rather than creating them at runtime.

### **Integration with System.Text.Json**

Minimal APIs are optimized to work with **System.Text.Json** for serializing and deserializing JSON. This requires setting up a **JsonSerializerContext** using the **System.Text.Json source generator**.

Here’s how you can configure the **JsonSerializerContext** for a minimal API:

```csharp
using System.Text.Json.Serialization;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateSlimBuilder(args);

builder.Services.ConfigureHttpJsonOptions(options =>
{
    options.SerializerOptions.TypeInfoResolverChain.Insert(0, AppJsonSerializerContext.Default);
});

var app = builder.Build();

var sampleTodos = new Todo[] {
    new(1, "Walk the dog"),
    new(2, "Do the dishes", DateOnly.FromDateTime(DateTime.Now)),
    new(3, "Do the laundry", DateOnly.FromDateTime(DateTime.Now.AddDays(1))),
    new(4, "Clean the bathroom"),
    new(5, "Clean the car", DateOnly.FromDateTime(DateTime.Now.AddDays(2)))
};

var todosApi = app.MapGroup("/todos");
todosApi.MapGet("/", () => sampleTodos);
todosApi.MapGet("/{id}", (int id) =>
    sampleTodos.FirstOrDefault(a => a.Id == id) is { } todo
        ? Results.Ok(todo)
        : Results.NotFound());

app.Run();

public record Todo(int Id, string? Title, DateOnly? DueBy = null, bool IsComplete = false);

[JsonSerializable(typeof(Todo[]))]
internal partial class AppJsonSerializerContext : JsonSerializerContext
{
}
```

### **Key Concepts in the Code:**

- **Map methods** (`MapGet`, `MapPost`) are used to define HTTP endpoints for your API.
- The **`Todo`** class is used to represent items that will be handled by the API.
- **`JsonSerializable` attribute**: This is used to generate the necessary serialization code for `Todo[]` at compile-time, leveraging the source generator.
- **TypeInfoResolverChain** is configured to ensure that the custom `JsonSerializerContext` is used.

### **Benefits of RDG and Native AOT for Minimal APIs**

1. **Faster Startup:** By compiling route handlers ahead of time, the app doesn’t need to generate request delegates on the fly during runtime, leading to **improved startup performance**.
   
2. **Native AOT Optimization:** The RDG ensures that the necessary types used in your APIs are rooted in the app's code, making them **compatible with Native AOT** and ensuring nothing necessary is trimmed during the build process.

3. **More Efficient Memory Use:** By enabling trimming and compiling the code ahead of time, only the necessary code is included in the final executable, reducing the app's memory footprint.

---

### **Conclusion**

The **Request Delegate Generator (RDG)** improves performance by ensuring that minimal API route handlers are pre-compiled into request delegates at build-time rather than at runtime. This is particularly valuable for apps that use **Native AOT** or **trimming**, as it allows for faster startup and more efficient memory usage. By automatically or manually enabling the RDG, developers can ensure that their minimal API apps are optimized for production, particularly when targeting Native AOT deployments.
