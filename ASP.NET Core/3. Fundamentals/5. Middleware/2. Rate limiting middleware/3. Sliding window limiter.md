### **Sliding Window Limiter in ASP.NET Core**

The **sliding window limiter** builds on the fixed window algorithm by adding finer-grained control using **segments** within each time window. This makes the rate limiting more flexible and precise by accounting for requests across overlapping time windows, reducing "burstiness."

---

### **How the Sliding Window Algorithm Works**
1. **Window and Segments:**
   - A window is divided into **n segments**, where:
     - Each segment represents a portion of the total window (e.g., if the window is 30 seconds and there are 3 segments, each segment is 10 seconds).
     - The **segment interval** is calculated as:
       \[
       \text{Segment Interval} = \frac{\text{Window Time}}{\text{Segments Per Window}}
       \]

2. **Request Limit:**
   - The **PermitLimit** specifies the total number of requests allowed for the entire window.

3. **Sliding Effect:**
   - As time progresses, requests are tracked within overlapping windows by "sliding" the segments.
   - Requests from expired segments are **recycled** and added back to the current segment. This ensures that requests spread over a longer period are not penalized excessively.

4. **Behavior:**
   - Requests are **recycled** (added back) from the **expired segment** of the previous window, ensuring that any unused capacity from prior segments can be reused.
   - A queue can hold requests that exceed the immediate limit for later processing, based on `QueueProcessingOrder` and `QueueLimit`.

### **Illustrative Example**

#### **Configuration:**
- **Window Time:** 30 seconds
- **Segments Per Window:** 3
- **PermitLimit:** 100 requests

#### **How Requests Are Processed:**
| **Time** | **Available** | **Taken** | **Recycled from Expired** | **Carry Over** |
|----------|---------------|-----------|---------------------------|----------------|
| 0        | 100           | 20        | 0                         | 80             |
| 10       | 80            | 30        | 0                         | 50             |
| 20       | 50            | 40        | 0                         | 10             |
| 30       | 10            | 30        | 20                        | 0              |
| 40       | 0             | 10        | 30                        | 20             |
| 50       | 20            | 10        | 40                        | 50             |
| 60       | 50            | 35        | 30                        | 45             |

- **Available:** The number of requests that can be processed at the start of the segment.
- **Taken:** Requests processed in the current segment.
- **Recycled from Expired:** Requests carried over from the expired segment of the previous window.
- **Carry Over:** Remaining requests available for the next segment.

### **Code Example: Sliding Window Limiter**

#### **Code:**
```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.RateLimiting;
using System.Threading.RateLimiting;
using WebRateLimitAuth.Models;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Load options from configuration
var myOptions = new MyRateLimitOptions();
builder.Configuration.GetSection(MyRateLimitOptions.MyRateLimit).Bind(myOptions);

var slidingPolicy = "sliding";

// Add the sliding window limiter service
builder.Services.AddRateLimiter(_ => _
    .AddSlidingWindowLimiter(policyName: slidingPolicy, options =>
    {
        options.PermitLimit = myOptions.PermitLimit; // Total requests allowed per window
        options.Window = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(myOptions.Window); // Total window duration
        options.SegmentsPerWindow = myOptions.SegmentsPerWindow; // Number of segments in the window
        options.QueueProcessingOrder = QueueProcessingOrder.OldestFirst; // Process oldest requests first
        options.QueueLimit = myOptions.QueueLimit; // Max requests that can be queued
    }));

var app = builder.Build();

app.UseRateLimiter(); // Enable the rate limiter middleware

static string GetTicks() => (DateTime.Now.Ticks & 0x11111).ToString("00000");

// Define an endpoint with the sliding window rate limiting policy
app.MapGet("/", () => Results.Ok($"Sliding Window Limiter {GetTicks()}"))
   .RequireRateLimiting(slidingPolicy);

app.Run();
```

### **Configuration-Driven Approach**

Using external configuration (like `appsettings.json`) simplifies maintenance.

#### **Configuration (`appsettings.json`):**
```json
{
  "MyRateLimitOptions": {
    "PermitLimit": 100,
    "Window": 30,
    "SegmentsPerWindow": 3,
    "QueueLimit": 2
  }
}
```

#### **Explanation:**
- **PermitLimit:** Total requests allowed per window.
- **Window:** Duration of the sliding window (in seconds).
- **SegmentsPerWindow:** Number of segments the window is divided into.
- **QueueLimit:** Maximum number of requests that can be queued.

---

### **Key Points**
1. **Granular Control:**
   - The sliding window algorithm enables more precise control over rate limiting by spreading requests over overlapping segments.

2. **Better Request Handling:**
   - Requests are recycled from expired segments, ensuring unused capacity from earlier periods is reused effectively.

3. **Middleware Placement:**
   - **Order Matters:** When endpoint-specific rate limiting is used (`RequireRateLimiting` or `[EnableRateLimiting]`), ensure that `UseRateLimiter` is called **after `UseRouting`**.

#### **Pipeline Example:**
```csharp
app.UseRouting();
app.UseRateLimiter();
app.UseEndpoints(endpoints => { ... });
```

4. **Testing Behavior:**
   - Send requests at different intervals and monitor how they are recycled across overlapping windows.

---

### **Summary**
The sliding window limiter in ASP.NET Core is a flexible and efficient rate-limiting mechanism that:
- Divides a fixed window into smaller segments.
- Provides better burst handling and smoother request distribution.
- Recycles unused request slots for optimal capacity utilization.

It's ideal for scenarios where consistent and fine-grained rate limiting is required.
