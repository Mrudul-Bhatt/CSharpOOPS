### **Middleware Activation with a Third-Party Container in ASP.NET Core**

This article demonstrates how to use a third-party Dependency Injection (DI) container, specifically **Simple Injector**, to handle middleware activation in ASP.NET Core. By leveraging `IMiddlewareFactory` and `IMiddleware` as extensibility points, you can implement custom logic for middleware instantiation and resolve dependencies from an external DI container.

### **Overview**

- The main goal is to use a **third-party DI container** (like Simple Injector) for middleware activation.
- The sample app demonstrates how to integrate Simple Injector with ASP.NET Core to manage middleware and scoped services (e.g., a database context).
- The sample middleware logs the value of a query string parameter (`key`) into an in-memory database using a **scoped `DbContext`**.

### **Key Concepts**

1. **`IMiddlewareFactory`**:
   - The `IMiddlewareFactory` interface provides methods to create and release middleware instances. By implementing this interface, we can control how middleware instances are created using an external DI container like Simple Injector.

2. **`IMiddleware`**:
   - The `IMiddleware` interface defines the contract for middleware in ASP.NET Core, with the `InvokeAsync` method responsible for handling HTTP requests.

3. **Third-Party DI Container**:
   - In this example, **Simple Injector** is used as a DI container for resolving middleware and scoped services.
   - This approach provides flexibility for managing dependencies and middleware instantiation outside the built-in ASP.NET Core DI container.

### **Implementation Details**

#### 1. **Custom Middleware Factory** (`SimpleInjectorMiddlewareFactory`):

The custom `SimpleInjectorMiddlewareFactory` class implements `IMiddlewareFactory`. It resolves middleware instances using the Simple Injector container:

```csharp
public class SimpleInjectorMiddlewareFactory : IMiddlewareFactory
{
    private readonly Container _container;

    public SimpleInjectorMiddlewareFactory(Container container)
    {
        _container = container;
    }

    // Create a middleware instance using Simple Injector
    public IMiddleware Create(Type middlewareType)
    {
        return _container.GetInstance(middlewareType) as IMiddleware;
    }

    // Release middleware resources (managed by the container)
    public void Release(IMiddleware middleware)
    {
        // The container is responsible for releasing resources.
    }
}
```

- `Create`: Resolves an instance of the requested middleware type.
- `Release`: Releases the middleware instance. In Simple Injector, this is handled automatically when the scope ends.

#### 2. **Middleware Implementation** (`SimpleInjectorActivatedMiddleware`):

This middleware uses **dependency injection** to get an instance of `AppDbContext` (a scoped service) and logs a query string value (`key`) into the database:

```csharp
public class SimpleInjectorActivatedMiddleware : IMiddleware
{
    private readonly AppDbContext _db;

    public SimpleInjectorActivatedMiddleware(AppDbContext db)
    {
        _db = db;
    }

    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context, RequestDelegate next)
    {
        var keyValue = context.Request.Query["key"];

        if (!string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(keyValue))
        {
            _db.Add(new Request
            {
                DT = DateTime.UtcNow, 
                MiddlewareActivation = "SimpleInjectorActivatedMiddleware", 
                Value = keyValue
            });

            await _db.SaveChangesAsync();
        }

        await next(context); // Pass the request to the next middleware
    }
}
```

- The `InvokeAsync` method handles the request, checks for the query string parameter (`key`), and writes the value to the database.
- After processing the request, the middleware calls `next(context)` to forward the request to the next middleware in the pipeline.

#### 3. **Middleware Extension**:

To add the middleware to the request processing pipeline, an extension method is created:

```csharp
public static class MiddlewareExtensions
{
    public static IApplicationBuilder UseSimpleInjectorActivatedMiddleware(
        this IApplicationBuilder builder)
    {
        return builder.UseMiddleware<SimpleInjectorActivatedMiddleware>();
    }
}
```

This allows us to register the middleware in `Startup.cs` with the `UseSimpleInjectorActivatedMiddleware` method.

#### 4. **Service Configuration in `ConfigureServices`**:

The `ConfigureServices` method sets up the **Simple Injector container** and registers necessary services:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddRazorPages();

    // Use the SimpleInjectorMiddlewareFactory to resolve middleware
    services.AddTransient<IMiddlewareFactory>(_ =>
    {
        return new SimpleInjectorMiddlewareFactory(_container);
    });

    // Setup Simple Injector request scoping
    services.UseSimpleInjectorAspNetRequestScoping(_container);

    // Register the DbContext and middleware in Simple Injector container
    services.AddScoped<AppDbContext>(provider => 
        _container.GetInstance<AppDbContext>());

    _container.Options.DefaultScopedLifestyle = new AsyncScopedLifestyle();

    // Register middleware and DbContext
    _container.Register<AppDbContext>(() => 
    {
        var optionsBuilder = new DbContextOptionsBuilder<DbContext>();
        optionsBuilder.UseInMemoryDatabase("InMemoryDb");
        return new AppDbContext(optionsBuilder.Options);
    }, Lifestyle.Scoped);

    _container.Register<SimpleInjectorActivatedMiddleware>();

    _container.Verify(); // Verify the container configuration
}
```

- The **`IMiddlewareFactory`** is replaced by `SimpleInjectorMiddlewareFactory` for custom middleware instantiation.
- The `DbContext` is registered as a **scoped** service, which ensures that each HTTP request gets a new instance.
- The **`SimpleInjectorActivatedMiddleware`** is registered with Simple Injector, allowing it to be resolved during middleware activation.

#### 5. **Middleware Registration in `Configure`**:

The middleware is added to the application's request processing pipeline:

```csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
    if (env.IsDevelopment())
    {
        app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
    }
    else
    {
        app.UseExceptionHandler("/Error");
    }

    // Add Simple Injector activated middleware
    app.UseSimpleInjectorActivatedMiddleware();

    app.UseStaticFiles();
    app.UseRouting();

    app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
    {
        endpoints.MapRazorPages();
    });
}
```

- The `UseSimpleInjectorActivatedMiddleware` extension method is used to add the middleware to the pipeline.

### **Summary**

- **Custom Middleware Activation with Third-Party Container**: In this example, **Simple Injector** is used to activate middleware through a custom `IMiddlewareFactory`. This approach allows for more flexible control over how middleware is instantiated, particularly when using third-party DI containers.
- **Scoped Dependencies**: The middleware can inject scoped services (like `DbContext`) by relying on the third-party container's capabilities.
- **Custom `IMiddlewareFactory`**: The `SimpleInjectorMiddlewareFactory` is responsible for creating instances of middleware by resolving them from the Simple Injector container.
- **Service Registration**: The third-party container (Simple Injector) is configured to handle both middleware and scoped services (like `DbContext`), ensuring that dependencies are injected correctly during middleware activation.

This approach gives you more control over middleware instantiation and dependency management, making it a powerful option for complex applications with external DI containers.
