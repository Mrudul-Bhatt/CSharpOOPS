### **Middleware in Minimal API Apps**

In **Minimal API** applications, the **middleware pipeline** is a critical concept. Middleware are software components that are executed in sequence to process HTTP requests and responses. In **Minimal APIs**, ASP.NET Core automatically configures a standard set of middleware based on certain conditions, simplifying the setup process for developers.

### **Automatic Middleware Configuration**

When building a **Minimal API**, WebApplication automatically adds the following middleware, depending on the conditions of your app:

1. **`UseDeveloperExceptionPage()`**:
   - This middleware is added **first** when the **environment** is **"Development"**. It provides detailed exception information, which is useful for debugging.

2. **`UseRouting()`**:
   - This middleware is added **second** to enable routing of requests based on configured endpoints (`MapGet`, `MapPost`, etc.).
   - It is only added if user code doesn't already explicitly call `UseRouting` and if there are **endpoints** configured.

3. **`UseEndpoints()`**:
   - This is added **last** in the middleware pipeline. It processes the endpoints configured using `MapGet`, `MapPost`, and other endpoint mapping methods.
   - This is not called directly in the application since it is automatically added when endpoints are mapped.

4. **`UseAuthentication()`**:
   - This middleware is added **after `UseRouting`**, but only if **authentication** is configured.
   - It is included if `AddAuthentication` is used and **`IAuthenticationSchemeProvider`** can be found in the service provider. This is typically the case when you configure authentication (like JWT or cookies) in your app.

5. **`UseAuthorization()`**:
   - This middleware is added **after `UseAuthentication`**, but only if **authorization** is configured.
   - It is included if `AddAuthorization` is used and **`IAuthorizationHandlerProvider`** is detected in the service provider. This is used for role-based or policy-based authorization.

6. **User-configured middleware and endpoints**:
   - These are added between **`UseRouting()`** and **`UseEndpoints()`**.
   - Developers can configure custom middleware (such as logging, custom authentication checks) and add more endpoints.

### **Example Code of Middleware Pipeline**

In essence, the automatic middleware pipeline that ASP.NET Core creates for a Minimal API app looks something like this:

```csharp
if (isDevelopment)
{
    app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
}

app.UseRouting();

if (isAuthenticationConfigured)
{
    app.UseAuthentication();
}

if (isAuthorizationConfigured)
{
    app.UseAuthorization();
}

// user middleware/endpoints
app.CustomMiddleware(...);
app.MapGet("/", () => "hello world");
// end user middleware/endpoints

app.UseEndpoints(e => {});
```

### **Customizing Middleware Order**

Sometimes, the default middleware configuration isn't sufficient for your app, and you'll need to modify it.

#### **Changing Middleware Order**

1. **`UseCors()`**:
   - If you need to configure **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**, `UseCors()` must be called **before** `UseAuthentication()` and `UseAuthorization()` in the middleware pipeline.
   - CORS needs to be processed before authorization because CORS headers should be sent before any authentication or authorization logic.

   ```csharp
   app.UseCors();
   app.UseAuthentication();
   app.UseAuthorization();
   ```

2. **Middleware Before Route Matching**:
   - If you need middleware to run **before route matching** occurs, place the middleware **before `UseRouting()`**.
   - For example, a custom logging or request-processing middleware should run before routing to inspect or modify the request.

   ```csharp
   app.Use((context, next) =>
   {
       // Custom middleware logic
       return next(context);
   });

   app.UseRouting();

   // other middleware and endpoints
   ```

3. **Terminal Middleware**:
   - A **terminal middleware** is middleware that ends the request processing and sends a response (e.g., `app.Run()`).
   - It must be added **after `UseEndpoints()`** in the pipeline to ensure that routing and endpoints are processed before the terminal middleware handles the response.

   ```csharp
   app.UseRouting();

   app.MapGet("/", () => "hello world");

   app.UseEndpoints(e => {});

   app.Run(context =>
   {
       context.Response.StatusCode = 404;
       return Task.CompletedTask;
   });
   ```

### **Additional Considerations**

- **Terminal Middleware**: The `Run` method is an example of terminal middleware. This will **end the request pipeline**, meaning no other middleware or endpoints will be executed after it.
  
- **Antiforgery Middleware**: In some cases, you might need to prevent **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** attacks. This can be done using antiforgery middleware, which ensures that POST requests are validated by a token to prevent malicious attacks.

### **Summary**

- In **Minimal API apps**, **ASP.NET Core automatically configures middleware** for routing, authentication, authorization, and exception handling.
- You can **customize the middleware order** by explicitly adding middleware before or after `UseRouting()` or `UseEndpoints()`, depending on your needs.
- **CORS**, **authentication**, and **authorization** need specific ordering to function correctly, particularly with **CORS** placed before authentication and authorization.
- **Terminal middleware** (like `app.Run()`) must be placed **after `UseEndpoints()`** to handle requests when no endpoint matches.
