### **Pipelines in ASP.NET Core**

Pipelines in ASP.NET Core provide an advanced mechanism for efficiently handling streaming data, such as request bodies or response bodies. Unlike traditional `Stream`-based approaches, which involve manually managing byte arrays and buffers, pipelines allow for efficient, non-blocking data processing, with better memory management. 

ASP.NET Core introduces the concept of a **PipeReader** and **PipeWriter**, which enable the reading and writing of data in a more optimized and performant way.

### **Key Components: PipeReader and PipeWriter**

1. **PipeReader**: 
   - Used for reading data asynchronously in a memory-efficient way.
   - Helps process data in chunks, which reduces memory allocations.

2. **PipeWriter**:
   - Used for writing data to a response body or other streams.

These two abstractions enable more efficient, scalable data processing and avoid memory allocation pitfalls associated with traditional streams.

### **Example: Reading Request Body with PipeReader**

In this example, a `PipeReader` is used to read the request body, split it by newlines, and add each line to a list:

```csharp
private async Task<List<string>> GetListOfStringFromPipe(PipeReader reader)
{
    List<string> results = new List<string>();

    while (true)
    {
        // Read the data asynchronously from the PipeReader
        ReadResult readResult = await reader.ReadAsync();
        var buffer = readResult.Buffer;

        SequencePosition? position = null;

        // Loop to process the data in the buffer
        do
        {
            // Search for the end of line character (newline)
            position = buffer.PositionOf((byte)'\n');

            if (position != null)
            {
                // Slice the buffer up to the newline character
                var readOnlySequence = buffer.Slice(0, position.Value);
                AddStringToList(results, in readOnlySequence);

                // Skip the line and the newline character
                buffer = buffer.Slice(buffer.GetPosition(1, position.Value));
            }
        }
        while (position != null);

        // If the reader is done and there is leftover data, process it
        if (readResult.IsCompleted && buffer.Length > 0)
        {
            AddStringToList(results, in buffer);
        }

        // Advance the reader to the next segment of the buffer
        reader.AdvanceTo(buffer.Start, buffer.End);

        // Exit if the reader is completed and no more data is available
        if (readResult.IsCompleted)
        {
            break;
        }
    }

    return results;
}

private static void AddStringToList(List<string> results, in ReadOnlySequence<byte> readOnlySequence)
{
    // Convert the read-only sequence of bytes to a string and add it to the list
    ReadOnlySpan<byte> span = readOnlySequence.IsSingleSegment ? readOnlySequence.First.Span : readOnlySequence.ToArray().AsSpan();
    results.Add(Encoding.UTF8.GetString(span));
}
```

#### **Key Points in the Code**:

- **`PipeReader.ReadAsync()`**: Reads data asynchronously from the pipe.
- **`buffer.PositionOf()`**: Finds the position of a specific byte (in this case, the newline character `'\n'`).
- **`Slice()`**: Creates a slice of the buffer up to the found position.
- **`reader.AdvanceTo()`**: Advances the `PipeReader` to the next unread portion of the buffer, making the data available for future reads.
- **`AddStringToList()`**: Converts the `ReadOnlySequence<byte>` (which can span across multiple segments of memory) into a UTF-8 string and adds it to a list.

### **Advantages Over Streams**:

1. **Memory Efficiency**: 
   - `PipeReader` handles data incrementally without holding onto entire buffers in memory, preventing the need to allocate large string buffers.
   - No intermediate allocations, as the sequence of bytes is processed and converted to strings directly when required.

2. **Improved Performance**:
   - **No unnecessary copying**: The data is processed directly from the buffer, and only the relevant portions are sliced and processed, which minimizes memory overhead.
   - **Async processing**: The `PipeReader` allows for non-blocking reads, improving overall performance, especially for large requests.

3. **Easier Handling of Data in Chunks**:
   - Unlike streams, where you need to handle data manually, pipelines handle data in chunks, which makes it easier to process large amounts of data incrementally.

### **Body Adapters: `BodyReader` and `BodyWriter`**

ASP.NET Core provides automatic adapters for the request and response bodies:

- **`HttpRequest.BodyReader`** is a `PipeReader` that wraps around `HttpRequest.Body` (which is a `Stream`).
- **`HttpResponse.BodyWriter`** is a `PipeWriter` that wraps around `HttpResponse.Body` (which is also a `Stream`).

When the `Body` is assigned a new stream, the respective `BodyReader` or `BodyWriter` are automatically updated to wrap the new stream, ensuring seamless integration with the pipeline mechanism.

### **Using `HttpResponse.StartAsync()` with Pipelines**

In scenarios involving the use of Kestrel as a web server, **`HttpResponse.StartAsync()`** can be used to indicate that the HTTP headers are finalized and that the response body can now be written. When using **`PipeReader`**, calling **`StartAsync()`** ensures that any memory used for the internal buffers belongs to Kestrel's internal pipe rather than an external buffer. This can prevent memory fragmentation and improve performance, especially when handling large amounts of data.

---

### **Summary**

1. **Pipelines** (via `PipeReader` and `PipeWriter`) are an advanced way to handle request and response bodies efficiently, particularly for scenarios involving large streams of data.
2. **Memory Efficiency**: Pipelines allow for efficient memory management by processing data in chunks and avoiding unnecessary allocations.
3. **Improved Performance**: Non-blocking and incremental reading/writing of data, making it scalable for high-throughput applications.
4. **Automatic Body Adaptation**: ASP.NET Core automatically adapts streams to the `PipeReader` and `PipeWriter` when dealing with HTTP request and response bodies.

Pipelines are the recommended approach for handling request/response body data in ASP.NET Core, providing better performance and scalability than traditional `Stream`-based handling.
