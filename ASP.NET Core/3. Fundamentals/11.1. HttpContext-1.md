Sure, let's delve into the first four subpoints of the "Use HttpContext in ASP.NET Core" article, which covers aspects of the `HttpContext` object related to HTTP requests and responses.

### 1. HttpRequest

#### Overview:
The `HttpRequest` object provides access to the details of the incoming HTTP request. It is a part of the `HttpContext` and includes properties and methods to retrieve information such as headers, query strings, form data, and more.

#### Key Properties and Methods:
- **Headers:** Access the headers of the request.
  ```csharp
  var userAgent = HttpContext.Request.Headers["User-Agent"].ToString();
  ```
- **Query:** Access query string parameters.
  ```csharp
  var queryParam = HttpContext.Request.Query["param"].ToString();
  ```
- **Form:** Access form data (for POST requests with form data).
  ```csharp
  var formValue = HttpContext.Request.Form["fieldName"].ToString();
  ```
- **Method:** Retrieve the HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST).
  ```csharp
  var method = HttpContext.Request.Method;
  ```
- **Path:** Get the request path.
  ```csharp
  var path = HttpContext.Request.Path;
  ```

### 2. HttpResponse

#### Overview:
The `HttpResponse` object provides mechanisms to configure and send the HTTP response back to the client. It includes properties and methods to set headers, status codes, and body content.

#### Key Properties and Methods:
- **StatusCode:** Set the HTTP status code for the response.
  ```csharp
  HttpContext.Response.StatusCode = 200; // OK
  ```
- **Headers:** Set or get response headers.
  ```csharp
  HttpContext.Response.Headers["Custom-Header"] = "HeaderValue";
  ```
- **ContentType:** Specify the content type of the response.
  ```csharp
  HttpContext.Response.ContentType = "text/plain";
  ```
- **WriteAsync:** Write content to the response body.
  ```csharp
  await HttpContext.Response.WriteAsync("Hello, World!");
  ```

### 3. RequestAborted

#### Overview:
The `RequestAborted` property provides a `CancellationToken` that is triggered when the client disconnects or cancels the request. This is useful for aborting long-running operations when the client is no longer waiting for the response.

#### Example Usage:
- **Checking for Cancellation:**
  ```csharp
  if (HttpContext.RequestAborted.IsCancellationRequested)
  {
      // Handle the cancellation, e.g., by stopping a long-running task
      return;
  }
  ```
- **Passing the Token to Asynchronous Methods:**
  ```csharp
  await SomeLongRunningOperationAsync(HttpContext.RequestAborted);
  ```

### 4. Abort()

#### Overview:
The `Abort` method on the `HttpContext` object is used to immediately terminate the HTTP connection. This can be useful in scenarios where you need to forcefully close the connection, such as when detecting malicious activity or handling severe errors.

#### Example Usage:
- **Aborting the Connection:**
  ```csharp
  HttpContext.Abort();
  ```

### Summary:

These subpoints cover essential aspects of handling HTTP requests and responses in ASP.NET Core. The `HttpRequest` and `HttpResponse` objects provide comprehensive mechanisms for accessing request data and configuring responses. The `RequestAborted` property and `Abort` method offer ways to handle and respond to client disconnections and other exceptional scenarios effectively.
