### **App Startup in ASP.NET Core**

In ASP.NET Core, the app startup process is configured primarily in the **Program.cs** file. This file is central to defining services and middleware for the application, determining how it will handle requests.

#### **App Startup Process Overview**

1. **Create the Application Builder**: The `WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args)` method is used to initialize the app builder, which provides access to services and configuration.
   
2. **Add Services to the Container**: The `builder.Services` collection is used to register various services required by the application. These services can include:
   - **Razor Components**: `AddRazorComponents()`
   - **Razor Pages**: `AddRazorPages()`
   - **MVC Controllers with Views**: `AddControllersWithViews()`

3. **Build the Application**: The `builder.Build()` method constructs the app object.

4. **Configure the HTTP Request Pipeline**: The app's middleware pipeline is defined here, specifying how requests should be handled.

   - **Development vs. Production**: Different middleware is used depending on the environment. For example, error handling is different for development and production environments.
   - **HTTPS Redirection**: The `app.UseHttpsRedirection()` ensures that requests are redirected to HTTPS.
   - **Static Files**: `app.UseStaticFiles()` serves static files like images, CSS, and JS.
   - **Authorization**: The `app.UseAuthorization()` middleware is used for securing routes or endpoints.

5. **Map Endpoints**: Different kinds of endpoints are mapped for various components, such as:
   - `app.MapGet("/hi", () => "Hello!")`: Mapping minimal API endpoints.
   - `app.MapRazorPages()`: Mapping Razor Pages.
   - `app.MapDefaultControllerRoute()`: Mapping MVC controller routes.
   - `app.MapRazorComponents<App>()`: Mapping Blazor components.

6. **Run the Application**: Finally, `app.Run()` starts the application and begins processing incoming requests.

#### **Example Startup Code:**
```csharp
using WebAll.Components;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Add services to the container
builder.Services.AddRazorComponents()
    .AddInteractiveServerComponents();
builder.Services.AddRazorPages();
builder.Services.AddControllersWithViews();

var app = builder.Build();

// Configure the HTTP request pipeline
if (!app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
{
    app.UseExceptionHandler("/Error");
    app.UseHsts();
}

app.UseHttpsRedirection();
app.UseStaticFiles();

app.UseAuthorization();

// Define endpoints
app.MapGet("/hi", () => "Hello!");
app.MapDefaultControllerRoute();
app.MapRazorPages();
app.MapRazorComponents<App>().AddInteractiveServerRenderMode();

app.UseAntiforgery();

app.Run();
```
This example shows how to configure various services and middleware in an ASP.NET Core application, as well as map multiple types of endpoints.

### **Extending Startup with Startup Filters**

**IStartupFilter** allows you to extend and modify the middleware pipeline by injecting custom middleware at the beginning or end of the pipeline without manually calling `Use{Middleware}` for each one. This is useful for scenarios where you want to configure middleware dynamically or from external components.

#### **How IStartupFilter Works:**

1. **Configure Middleware**: The `IStartupFilter.Configure` method receives an `IApplicationBuilder` and returns an `Action<IApplicationBuilder>`. This enables you to add custom middleware.

2. **Order of Filters**: Multiple `IStartupFilter` implementations can be added. The order in which they are registered determines the order in which their middleware runs in the pipeline.

3. **Use Case**: A common use case is to add middleware that modifies the request or response before or after other middlewares run.

#### **Example: RequestSetOptionsMiddleware**

The example demonstrates how to use `IStartupFilter` to add custom middleware that processes query string parameters before they reach the other middleware.

1. **Middleware Implementation**:
   The `RequestSetOptionsMiddleware` looks for a query string parameter (`option`) and stores its value in the `HttpContext.Items`.

   ```csharp
   public class RequestSetOptionsMiddleware
   {
       private readonly RequestDelegate _next;

       public RequestSetOptionsMiddleware(RequestDelegate next)
       {
           _next = next;
       }

       public async Task Invoke(HttpContext httpContext)
       {
           var option = httpContext.Request.Query["option"];
           if (!string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(option))
           {
               httpContext.Items["option"] = WebUtility.HtmlEncode(option);
           }
           await _next(httpContext);
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Startup Filter Implementation**:
   The `RequestSetOptionsStartupFilter` uses `IStartupFilter` to insert `RequestSetOptionsMiddleware` into the pipeline.

   ```csharp
   public class RequestSetOptionsStartupFilter : IStartupFilter
   {
       public Action<IApplicationBuilder> Configure(Action<IApplicationBuilder> next)
       {
           return builder =>
           {
               builder.UseMiddleware<RequestSetOptionsMiddleware>();
               next(builder);
           };
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Registering the Startup Filter**:
   Finally, the filter is registered in `Program.cs` to add the middleware during app startup.

   ```csharp
   var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
   builder.Services.AddRazorPages();
   builder.Services.AddTransient<IStartupFilter, RequestSetOptionsStartupFilter>();
   ```

4. **Usage in Razor Page**:
   The Razor page can then access the `option` value from the `HttpContext.Items`.

   ```html
   <h1>@ViewData["Title"]</h1>
   <p>Option String: @HttpContext.Items["option"]</p>
   ```

### **Add Configuration at Startup from External Assemblies**

In some cases, you might want to extend the application's startup logic from external assemblies. This can be done by implementing `IHostingStartup`. This allows you to add custom configuration or services during the startup phase, without modifying the main `Program.cs` file of the application.

#### **Example: IHostingStartup**

An `IHostingStartup` implementation can be added from an external assembly, providing a way to inject additional services, middleware, or configuration without touching the primary app's codebase.

For more information, see [Use hosting startup assemblies in ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/hosting-startup).

### **Summary**

1. **App Startup**: The startup configuration of an ASP.NET Core app is handled in the `Program.cs` file, where you register services and configure middleware for handling HTTP requests.
2. **IStartupFilter**: Allows you to insert custom middleware before or after other middlewares in the app's request pipeline. It's useful for configuring middleware dynamically or from external sources.
3. **External Configuration**: You can enhance your app startup using `IHostingStartup` to load configuration or services from external assemblies.

This flexibility in ASP.NET Core's startup process helps build applications that are highly customizable and maintainable.
