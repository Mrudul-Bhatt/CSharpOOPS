The article "HTTP logging in ASP.NET Core" on Microsoft Docs provides a detailed guide on how to enable and configure HTTP logging in an ASP.NET Core application. HTTP logging is crucial for monitoring and debugging web applications, as it captures detailed information about HTTP requests and responses. Hereâ€™s a summary of the key points covered in the article:

### Key Points:

1. **Introduction to HTTP Logging:**
   - HTTP logging captures detailed information about HTTP requests and responses, which is useful for debugging and monitoring web applications.
   - ASP.NET Core provides built-in support for HTTP logging using middleware.

2. **Enabling HTTP Logging:**
   - To enable HTTP logging, you need to add the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpLogging` package to your project.
   - HTTP logging is configured in the `Startup` class by adding the HTTP logging middleware to the request pipeline.

   Example of enabling HTTP logging in `Startup.cs`:
   ```csharp
   public class Startup
   {
       public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
       {
           services.AddHttpLogging(logging =>
           {
               logging.LoggingFields = HttpLoggingFields.All;
           });
       }

       public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
       {
           app.UseHttpLogging();

           // Other middleware registrations
           app.UseRouting();
           app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
           {
               endpoints.MapControllers();
           });
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Configuring HTTP Logging:**
   - HTTP logging can be configured to capture specific fields such as request and response headers, body, and properties.
   - You can configure the logging fields using the `HttpLoggingOptions.LoggingFields` property.

   Example of configuring specific logging fields:
   ```csharp
   services.AddHttpLogging(logging =>
   {
       logging.LoggingFields = HttpLoggingFields.RequestPropertiesAndHeaders |
                               HttpLoggingFields.ResponsePropertiesAndHeaders;
   });
   ```

4. **Log Request and Response Bodies:**
   - Logging request and response bodies can be useful but should be done with caution due to potential performance implications and security concerns.
   - To log request and response bodies, you need to configure the `RequestBodyLogLimit` and `ResponseBodyLogLimit` properties.

   Example of logging request and response bodies:
   ```csharp
   services.AddHttpLogging(logging =>
   {
       logging.LoggingFields = HttpLoggingFields.All;
       logging.RequestBodyLogLimit = 4096; // Log up to 4 KB of request body
       logging.ResponseBodyLogLimit = 4096; // Log up to 4 KB of response body
   });
   ```

5. **Filtering HTTP Logs:**
   - You can filter HTTP logs to capture logs only for specific requests or responses.
   - This can be done by configuring the `HttpLoggingOptions.RequestHeaders` and `HttpLoggingOptions.ResponseHeaders` properties.

   Example of filtering logs for specific headers:
   ```csharp
   services.AddHttpLogging(logging =>
   {
       logging.RequestHeaders.Add("User-Agent");
       logging.ResponseHeaders.Add("Content-Type");
   });
   ```

6. **Sensitive Data:**
   - Be cautious when logging sensitive data such as authentication tokens, passwords, or personally identifiable information (PII).
   - Configure the logging to exclude sensitive headers and bodies.

7. **Performance Considerations:**
   - Logging can have performance implications, especially when logging large request and response bodies.
   - It's important to balance the need for detailed logs with the performance requirements of your application.

### Example Configuration:

Here is a complete example of enabling and configuring HTTP logging in an ASP.NET Core application:

```csharp
public class Startup
{
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        services.AddHttpLogging(logging =>
        {
            logging.LoggingFields = HttpLoggingFields.RequestPropertiesAndHeaders |
                                    HttpLoggingFields.ResponsePropertiesAndHeaders |
                                    HttpLoggingFields.RequestBody |
                                    HttpLoggingFields.ResponseBody;
            logging.RequestBodyLogLimit = 4096; // Log up to 4 KB of request body
            logging.ResponseBodyLogLimit = 4096; // Log up to 4 KB of response body

            // Filter to log specific headers
            logging.RequestHeaders.Add("User-Agent");
            logging.ResponseHeaders.Add("Content-Type");
        });
    }

    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
    {
        app.UseHttpLogging();

        // Other middleware registrations
        app.UseRouting();
        app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
        {
            endpoints.MapControllers();
        });
    }
}
```

### Conclusion:

HTTP logging in ASP.NET Core is a powerful feature for monitoring and debugging web applications. By enabling and configuring HTTP logging, you can capture detailed information about HTTP requests and responses, which is invaluable for diagnosing issues and understanding application behavior. However, it's important to configure logging carefully to avoid performance issues and ensure sensitive data is not logged.
