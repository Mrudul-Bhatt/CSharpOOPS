Certainly! Let's go through the remaining subpoints from the "ASP.NET Core metrics" article:

### 1. Opt-out of HTTP Metrics on Certain Endpoints and Requests

#### Overview:
Sometimes, you may want to exclude specific endpoints or requests from being tracked by HTTP metrics. This can help reduce noise in your metrics and focus on the most relevant data.

#### Steps to Opt-out of HTTP Metrics:

1. **Configure HTTP Metrics Middleware:**
   - Use the `UseHttpMetrics` method in the `Startup` class to configure the metrics middleware.

2. **Filter Specific Endpoints or Requests:**
   - Use the options provided by the `UseHttpMetrics` method to exclude certain endpoints or requests from metrics.

#### Example:
```csharp
public class Startup
{
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        services.AddControllers();
    }

    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
    {
        app.UseRouting();

        // Configure HTTP metrics middleware with filtering options
        app.UseHttpMetrics(options =>
        {
            options.IgnoreRoutes.Add("/health"); // Exclude the /health endpoint
            options.IgnoreRequest = (context) =>
            {
                // Exclude requests with a specific query parameter
                return context.Request.Query.ContainsKey("ignoreMetrics");
            };
        });

        app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
        {
            endpoints.MapControllers();
            endpoints.MapMetrics(); // Expose the /metrics endpoint
        });
    }
}
```

### 2. Create Custom Metrics

#### Overview:
Creating custom metrics allows you to track specific aspects of your application that are not covered by default metrics. This can provide deeper insights into application performance and behavior.

#### Steps to Create Custom Metrics:

1. **Install Prometheus Metrics Package:**
   - Ensure the `prometheus-net.AspNetCore` package is installed.

2. **Define Custom Metrics:**
   - Use the Prometheus .NET client library to define custom metrics such as counters, gauges, histograms, and summaries.

#### Example:
```csharp
using Prometheus;

public class CustomMetrics
{
    private static readonly Counter CustomCounter = Metrics.CreateCounter("custom_counter", "Description of custom counter");

    public void IncrementCounter()
    {
        CustomCounter.Inc();
    }
}

// Register the custom metrics in the Startup class
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddSingleton<CustomMetrics>();
}

// Use the custom metrics in a controller
public class SomeController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly CustomMetrics _customMetrics;

    public SomeController(CustomMetrics customMetrics)
    {
        _customMetrics = customMetrics;
    }

    [HttpGet("/increment")]
    public IActionResult Increment()
    {
        _customMetrics.IncrementCounter();
        return Ok();
    }
}
```

### 3. View Metrics in Grafana with OpenTelemetry and Prometheus

#### Overview:
Grafana is a powerful visualization tool that can be used to create dashboards from Prometheus data. OpenTelemetry is an observability framework for cloud-native software, which provides tools to collect metrics and traces.

#### Steps to View Metrics in Grafana:

1. **Set Up Prometheus:**
   - Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from your ASP.NET Core application's `/metrics` endpoint.

   ```yaml
   scrape_configs:
     - job_name: 'aspnetcore'
       scrape_interval: 5s
       static_configs:
         - targets: ['localhost:5000']
   ```

2. **Configure OpenTelemetry:**
   - Add and configure OpenTelemetry to collect and export metrics to Prometheus.

3. **Set Up Grafana:**
   - Install and configure Grafana.
   - Add Prometheus as a data source in Grafana.

4. **Create Dashboards:**
   - Use Grafana to create dashboards and visualize the metrics collected from your ASP.NET Core application.

### 4. Test Metrics in ASP.NET Core Apps

#### Overview:
Testing metrics ensures that the metrics you collect are accurate and meaningful. It involves validating that custom metrics are correctly incremented or observed.

#### Steps to Test Metrics:

1. **Write Unit Tests:**
   - Use unit testing frameworks like xUnit or MSTest to write tests for your custom metrics.

2. **Use Mocking Frameworks:**
   - Use mocking frameworks like Moq to mock dependencies and verify metric behaviors.

#### Example:
```csharp
using Xunit;
using Prometheus;

public class CustomMetricsTests
{
    [Fact]
    public void IncrementCounter_ShouldIncreaseCounterValue()
    {
        // Arrange
        var customMetrics = new CustomMetrics();
        var initialCount = Metrics.CreateCounter("custom_counter", "Description of custom counter").Value;

        // Act
        customMetrics.IncrementCounter();
        var finalCount = Metrics.CreateCounter("custom_counter", "Description of custom counter").Value;

        // Assert
        Assert.Equal(initialCount + 1, finalCount);
    }
}
```

### 5. ASP.NET Core Meters and Counters

#### Overview:
ASP.NET Core supports the use of meters and counters to track various metrics within the application. These are part of the .NET diagnostics tools and are used to collect high-fidelity metrics.

#### Steps to Use Meters and Counters:

1. **Define Meters and Counters:**
   - Use the `System.Diagnostics.Metrics` namespace to define meters and counters.

2. **Register and Use Meters:**
   - Register and use these meters and counters within your application code to track relevant metrics.

#### Example:
```csharp
using System.Diagnostics.Metrics;

public class MetricsService
{
    private static readonly Meter Meter = new Meter("MyApplication", "1.0.0");
    private static readonly Counter<int> RequestCounter = Meter.CreateCounter<int>("request_count", "requests", "Number of requests received");

    public void IncrementRequestCount()
    {
        RequestCounter.Add(1);
    }
}

// Register the metrics service in the Startup class
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddSingleton<MetricsService>();
}

// Use the metrics service in a controller
public class MetricsController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly MetricsService _metricsService;

    public MetricsController(MetricsService metricsService)
    {
        _metricsService = metricsService;
    }

    [HttpGet("/track")]
    public IActionResult Track()
    {
        _metricsService.IncrementRequestCount();
        return Ok();
    }
}
```

By understanding and implementing these concepts, you can effectively collect, customize, view, and test metrics in your ASP.NET Core applications. These practices help ensure that your application is performing optimally and provide valuable insights for monitoring and diagnostics. For more detailed information, you can refer to the official article on Microsoft Docs: [ASP.NET Core metrics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/performance/metrics).
