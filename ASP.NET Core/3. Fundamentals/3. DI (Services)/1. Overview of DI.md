### **Dependency Injection in ASP.NET Core**

Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used in ASP.NET Core to achieve Inversion of Control (IoC) between classes and their dependencies. This pattern allows for loose coupling, making the application easier to maintain and test.

#### **Why Dependency Injection?**

Without DI, dependencies are typically hardcoded within a class. This can create issues such as:
1. **Tight Coupling**: Classes directly depend on specific implementations, making changes to dependencies cumbersome.
2. **Difficult to Test**: Hardcoded dependencies are difficult to mock for unit tests.
3. **Scattered Configuration**: As an app grows, managing the dependencies of various classes becomes scattered and difficult to track.

DI addresses these issues by allowing classes to request dependencies from an external container, making the system more flexible and modular.

### **Basic Dependency Injection Example**

#### **Step 1: Defining the Dependency**

A dependency is typically an object that another object depends on. In the following example, `MyDependency` is a class that has a `WriteMessage` method:

```csharp
public class MyDependency
{
    public void WriteMessage(string message)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"MyDependency.WriteMessage called. Message: {message}");
    }
}
```

#### **Step 2: Using the Dependency Without DI**

In a non-DI approach, the `IndexModel` class directly instantiates `MyDependency`, making it tightly coupled:

```csharp
public class IndexModel : PageModel
{
    private readonly MyDependency _dependency = new MyDependency();

    public void OnGet()
    {
        _dependency.WriteMessage("IndexModel.OnGet");
    }
}
```

#### **Problems with the Non-DI Approach:**
1. **Tight Coupling**: The class is directly coupled with `MyDependency`. Changing `MyDependency` would require modifying the `IndexModel` class.
2. **Scattered Configuration**: If `MyDependency` has other dependencies, they would need to be manually configured in each class.
3. **Testing Issues**: Unit tests would be harder to implement because `MyDependency` is not easily mocked or substituted.

---

### **Implementing Dependency Injection**

To solve the above problems, we can introduce Dependency Injection. Here's how it works in ASP.NET Core:

#### **Step 1: Define an Interface for the Dependency**

Instead of depending directly on `MyDependency`, we define an interface `IMyDependency` that declares the `WriteMessage` method:

```csharp
public interface IMyDependency
{
    void WriteMessage(string message);
}
```

#### **Step 2: Implement the Interface**

`MyDependency` implements the `IMyDependency` interface:

```csharp
public class MyDependency : IMyDependency
{
    public void WriteMessage(string message)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"MyDependency.WriteMessage Message: {message}");
    }
}
```

#### **Step 3: Register the Dependency in the Service Container**

In the `Program.cs` file, we register the dependency in the built-in service container using the `AddScoped` method. This means that `MyDependency` will be created per request (scoped lifetime):

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Register services
builder.Services.AddScoped<IMyDependency, MyDependency>();

var app = builder.Build();
```

#### **Step 4: Inject the Dependency into the Class**

Now, instead of manually creating the `MyDependency` instance, we inject it into the `Index2Model` class using constructor injection:

```csharp
public class Index2Model : PageModel
{
    private readonly IMyDependency _myDependency;

    public Index2Model(IMyDependency myDependency)
    {
        _myDependency = myDependency;            
    }

    public void OnGet()
    {
        _myDependency.WriteMessage("Index2Model.OnGet");
    }
}
```

By using DI, the `Index2Model` class no longer depends on the concrete implementation `MyDependency`. Instead, it depends on the interface `IMyDependency`, which makes it easier to change the implementation without modifying the class itself.

---

### **Using Logging with Dependency Injection**

In the updated example, you can also use DI to inject a logger. Here’s how you can modify the `MyDependency` class to use the built-in logging system.

```csharp
public class MyDependency2 : IMyDependency
{
    private readonly ILogger<MyDependency2> _logger;

    public MyDependency2(ILogger<MyDependency2> logger)
    {
        _logger = logger;
    }

    public void WriteMessage(string message)
    {
        _logger.LogInformation($"MyDependency2.WriteMessage Message: {message}");
    }
}
```

The DI container automatically resolves and injects the `ILogger<MyDependency2>` dependency into `MyDependency2` when it is created.

#### **Register the Updated Implementation**

Update `Program.cs` to use `MyDependency2`:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddScoped<IMyDependency, MyDependency2>();
```

#### **Using Logging in a Razor Page**

For logging in Razor Pages or controllers, you can directly inject `ILogger<T>` into the constructor:

```csharp
public class AboutModel : PageModel
{
    private readonly ILogger _logger;

    public AboutModel(ILogger<AboutModel> logger)
    {
        _logger = logger;
    }
    
    public string Message { get; set; } = string.Empty;

    public void OnGet()
    {
        Message = $"About page visited at {DateTime.UtcNow.ToLongTimeString()}";
        _logger.LogInformation(Message);
    }
}
```

In this case, the `ILogger<AboutModel>` is automatically provided by the ASP.NET Core framework, so no additional registration in `Program.cs` is needed.

---

### **Dependency Graph**

When using DI, dependencies can themselves have dependencies. This creates a **dependency graph** or **dependency tree**, where each class may depend on others. The DI container resolves the entire graph and ensures that each class and dependency is properly instantiated.

For example, in the `MyDependency2` class, `ILogger<MyDependency2>` is also injected, and the DI container automatically resolves it when creating an instance of `MyDependency2`.

---

### **Service Lifetimes in DI**

ASP.NET Core supports three main types of service lifetimes:

1. **Transient**: A new instance of the service is created each time it’s requested.
   - Use for lightweight, stateless services.
   
2. **Scoped**: A new instance is created per request (usually for services tied to HTTP requests).
   - Use for services that need to maintain state throughout a single request.
   
3. **Singleton**: A single instance of the service is created and shared throughout the application's lifetime.
   - Use for services that are stateless or that should maintain the same instance for the entire application.

In the previous example, `IMyDependency` was registered with a **scoped** lifetime using `AddScoped`.

### **Conclusion**

- **Dependency Injection (DI)** is a powerful design pattern that enhances flexibility, maintainability, and testability in ASP.NET Core applications.
- By using **constructor injection**, dependencies are supplied automatically by the framework’s DI container.
- **Service lifetimes** such as **transient**, **scoped**, and **singleton** help manage the lifecycle of services, ensuring they are created and disposed of correctly.
- **Logging** and other services can be injected in the same way, making DI a core feature of ASP.NET Core development.
