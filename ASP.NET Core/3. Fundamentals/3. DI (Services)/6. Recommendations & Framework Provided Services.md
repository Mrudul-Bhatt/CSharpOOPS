### **Recommendations for Dependency Injection in .NET**

The recommendations below emphasize best practices for using Dependency Injection (DI) effectively and avoiding certain anti-patterns. These suggestions help maintain a clean, modular, and testable application.

---

### **1. Avoid Using the Service Locator Pattern**

The **Service Locator Pattern** is an anti-pattern where you explicitly request dependencies via a service locator (e.g., using `GetService()`), rather than letting the DI container automatically inject them into classes via constructor injection.

#### **Incorrect Approach - Service Locator Pattern**

```csharp
public class MyClass
{
    private readonly IOptionsMonitor<MyOptions> _optionsMonitor;

    public MyClass(IServiceProvider serviceProvider)
    {
        _optionsMonitor = serviceProvider.GetService<IOptionsMonitor<MyOptions>>();
    }

    public void MyMethod()
    {
        var option = _optionsMonitor.CurrentValue.Option;

        // Further logic...
    }
}
```

In the example above, `GetService()` is used to obtain `IOptionsMonitor<MyOptions>` from the `IServiceProvider`. This tightly couples the class to the DI container and makes it harder to test.

#### **Correct Approach - Constructor Injection**

Instead of using `GetService()`, prefer **constructor injection** to pass dependencies directly to the class at instantiation. This improves testability and adheres to the **Inversion of Control (IoC)** principle.

```csharp
public class MyClass
{
    private readonly IOptionsMonitor<MyOptions> _optionsMonitor;

    public MyClass(IOptionsMonitor<MyOptions> optionsMonitor)
    {
        _optionsMonitor = optionsMonitor;
    }

    public void MyMethod()
    {
        var option = _optionsMonitor.CurrentValue.Option;

        // Further logic...
    }
}
```

In this example, `IOptionsMonitor<MyOptions>` is injected through the constructor, which is the preferred and testable pattern.

### **2. Avoid Injecting a Factory that Resolves Dependencies at Runtime**

Injecting a factory that resolves dependencies at runtime is another variation of the **Service Locator Pattern**. It mixes Inversion of Control with runtime dependency resolution, which can obscure the control flow of dependencies in the application and complicate testing.

### **3. Avoid Static Access to `HttpContext`**

Accessing `HttpContext` through static methods (e.g., `IHttpContextAccessor.HttpContext`) introduces global state and makes it difficult to use DI effectively. Static access to `HttpContext` goes against the principles of DI because it makes services dependent on global state, and these services cannot be easily tested.

#### **Static Access Example:**

```csharp
// Avoid this kind of access
var context = IHttpContextAccessor.HttpContext;
```

Instead, always inject `IHttpContextAccessor` or `HttpContext` into your classes using **constructor injection** to make dependencies explicit and testable.

### **4. Recommended Patterns for Multi-Tenancy in DI**

In multi-tenant applications, DI can be leveraged to manage different configurations and services based on the tenant. Multi-tenancy refers to an architecture where a single instance of an application serves multiple tenants, where each tenant may have different configurations or data.

For building multi-tenant apps in **ASP.NET Core**, the **Orchard Core framework** is a great example. Orchard Core supports modular and multi-tenant application architectures, enabling you to handle different tenant configurations in a structured way.

You can use DI to inject tenant-specific services, allowing each tenant to have its own configuration, data context, etc. For example:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddScoped<IMultiTenantService, TenantService>();
```

In a multi-tenant setup, services can be scoped per tenant, allowing each tenant to have its own service instance.

### **Framework-Provided Services**

In .NET, many framework-provided services are registered by default in the DI container. These services provide core features and capabilities for the application, such as logging, options management, HTTP context, etc.

Below are some examples of framework-registered services and their lifetimes:

| **Service Type**                                      | **Lifetime** |
|------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.Builder.IApplicationBuilderFactory` | Transient |
| `IHostApplicationLifetime`                           | Singleton    |
| `IWebHostEnvironment`                                 | Singleton    |
| `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.IStartup`              | Singleton    |
| `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.IStartupFilter`        | Transient    |
| `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.Server.IServer`        | Singleton    |
| `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.IHttpContextFactory`      | Transient    |
| `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ILogger<TCategoryName>` | Singleton    |
| `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ILoggerFactory`        | Singleton    |
| `Microsoft.Extensions.ObjectPool.ObjectPoolProvider` | Singleton    |
| `Microsoft.Extensions.Options.IConfigureOptions<TOptions>` | Transient |
| `Microsoft.Extensions.Options.IOptions<TOptions>`   | Singleton    |
| `System.Diagnostics.DiagnosticSource`                | Singleton    |
| `System.Diagnostics.DiagnosticListener`              | Singleton    |

- **Singleton Services** are created once and shared across the application.
- **Transient Services** are created every time they are requested.
- **Scoped Services** (not shown in the table) exist for the duration of a request (in web applications).

These services are automatically available in your application, and you don't need to manually register them unless you want to configure them differently.

### **Conclusion**

In summary, the following recommendations should be followed when using DI in .NET:

1. **Avoid the Service Locator pattern**: Prefer constructor injection to ensure explicit and testable dependencies.
2. **Avoid runtime dependency resolution**: Instead of injecting a factory to resolve dependencies, use constructor injection for cleaner design and easier testing.
3. **Avoid static access to `HttpContext`**: This leads to hidden dependencies and hard-to-test code. Always inject the necessary services via DI.
4. **Leverage DI for multi-tenancy**: Use DI patterns that allow different configurations and services for each tenant in multi-tenant applications.
5. **Use framework-registered services**: The .NET framework provides many services that are automatically available in the DI container, such as logging, options management, and more.
