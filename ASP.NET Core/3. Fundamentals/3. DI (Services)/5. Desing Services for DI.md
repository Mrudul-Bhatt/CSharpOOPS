### **Designing Services for Dependency Injection in .NET**

When designing services for dependency injection (DI) in .NET, there are several best practices and principles you should follow to ensure clean, maintainable, and testable code.

---

### **1. Avoid Stateful, Static Classes and Members**
- **Avoid global state**: Designing apps to use **singleton services** instead of static classes or members ensures that dependencies are managed by the DI container, providing greater flexibility and testability.
- **Static classes**: Static classes introduce global state, making the system harder to test and manage. Singleton services, on the other hand, are controlled by the DI container, which automatically handles the service's lifecycle.

### **2. Avoid Direct Instantiation of Dependent Classes**
- **Avoid tight coupling**: Directly instantiating dependent classes within services leads to tight coupling between the service and the implementation. Instead, use DI to inject the dependencies, which decouples the components and improves testability.
- **Dependency Injection**: By registering and resolving dependencies via DI, you can switch implementations without modifying the dependent classes.

### **3. Keep Services Small, Well-Factored, and Testable**
- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: If a service has many dependencies, it might be doing too much. This is often a sign that the class has violated the SRP. Refactor the class by moving some of its responsibilities into other services or classes.
- **Testable services**: Smaller services are easier to unit test because they have fewer dependencies and responsibilities.

### **4. Focus on UI Concerns in Page Models and Controllers**
- **Separation of concerns**: In Razor Pages and MVC controllers, focus on handling UI-related tasks. These classes should ideally have minimal logic and delegate business logic to other services.

### **Service Disposal**

- **IDisposable**: If a service implements `IDisposable`, the DI container will automatically call `Dispose` when the service is no longer needed (e.g., when it's scoped or transient).
- **Scope of disposal**: Services that are registered as singleton are disposed of when the application shuts down. However, transient and scoped services are disposed of when their scope ends (typically at the end of a request in a web application).

#### **Example of Service Disposal**

Consider the following services:

```csharp
public class Service1 : IDisposable
{
    private bool _disposed;

    public void Write(string message)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Service1: {message}");
    }

    public void Dispose()
    {
        if (_disposed) return;
        Console.WriteLine("Service1.Dispose");
        _disposed = true;
    }
}
```

```csharp
public class Service2 : IDisposable
{
    private bool _disposed;

    public void Write(string message)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Service2: {message}");
    }

    public void Dispose()
    {
        if (_disposed) return;
        Console.WriteLine("Service2.Dispose");
        _disposed = true;
    }
}
```

You register these services with DI as follows:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddScoped<Service1>(); // Scoped service
builder.Services.AddSingleton<Service2>(); // Singleton service
```

When a service is resolved (e.g., in a Razor Page), it will automatically be disposed when the scope ends (for scoped services) or at application shutdown (for singleton services).

### **Example Output of Service Disposal**

For services registered in the DI container, when the `Dispose` method is invoked, you might see output like this in the console:

```
Service1: IndexModel.OnGet
Service2: IndexModel.OnGet
Service3: IndexModel.OnGet, MyKey = MyKey from appsettings.Development.json
Service1.Dispose
```

- **Scoped Services** (like `Service1`) are disposed when the scope ends.
- **Singleton Services** (like `Service2`) are disposed when the application shuts down.

---

### **Services Not Created by the DI Container**

If you create instances manually (i.e., not through DI), the container **won't manage their lifecycle**, and you are responsible for disposing of them:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddSingleton(new Service1()); // Not managed by DI container
builder.Services.AddSingleton(new Service2()); // Not managed by DI container
```

In this case, the developer must ensure proper disposal, as the container does not manage these services.

### **Recommendations for Dependency Injection**

#### **1. Avoid Service Locator Pattern**
- The **Service Locator** pattern (e.g., using `GetService` directly to resolve services) violates **Inversion of Control (IoC)** and should be avoided. It makes your code harder to test and maintain.
  
Example of **incorrect** service locator pattern:

```csharp
public class MyClass
{
    private readonly IOptionsMonitor<MyOptions> _optionsMonitor;

    public MyClass(IServiceProvider serviceProvider)
    {
        _optionsMonitor = serviceProvider.GetService<IOptionsMonitor<MyOptions>>();
    }
}
```

Correct approach using constructor injection:

```csharp
public class MyClass
{
    private readonly IOptionsMonitor<MyOptions> _optionsMonitor;

    public MyClass(IOptionsMonitor<MyOptions> optionsMonitor)
    {
        _optionsMonitor = optionsMonitor;
    }
}
```

#### **2. Avoid Static Access to `HttpContext`**
- Using static access patterns (like `IHttpContextAccessor.HttpContext`) can hinder the benefits of DI and make it harder to test your application. Instead, inject `HttpContext` into services via constructor injection to follow DI principles and allow easier testing.

---

### **Recommended Patterns for Multi-Tenancy**

For **multi-tenant applications**, DI can be used to manage services that differ between tenants (e.g., a database connection string). A pattern like **scoped services per tenant** can be used to ensure that each tenant gets its own set of dependencies.

The **Orchard Core** framework provides excellent examples for building modular and multi-tenant applications using DI. For more information, you can check out the **Orchard Core Documentation**.

### **Conclusion**

- Design services for DI by following best practices: avoid global state, use constructor injection, keep services small, and adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle.
- The DI container manages the disposal of services that implement `IDisposable`, but for services created manually, disposal is the developer's responsibility.
- Avoid patterns like **Service Locator** or **static HttpContext access**, as they can make your application more difficult to maintain and test.
- Use DI effectively for managing services in multi-tenant applications and ensure clean, testable, and decoupled code.
