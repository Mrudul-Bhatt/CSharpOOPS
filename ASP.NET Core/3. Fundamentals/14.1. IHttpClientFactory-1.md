Certainly! Let's go through the first four subpoints of the "Make HTTP requests using IHttpClientFactory in ASP.NET Core" article:

### 1. Consumption Patterns

#### Overview:
Consumption patterns refer to the different ways you can use `IHttpClientFactory` to create and manage `HttpClient` instances. This includes named clients, typed clients, and basic usage patterns.

#### Key Points:
- **Basic Usage:** Directly use `IHttpClientFactory` to create `HttpClient` instances.
- **Named Clients:** Define and configure multiple `HttpClient` instances with specific names.
- **Typed Clients:** Define a class that consumes `HttpClient` with custom configuration.

#### Example:

**Basic Usage:**
```csharp
public class MyService
{
    private readonly IHttpClientFactory _clientFactory;

    public MyService(IHttpClientFactory clientFactory)
    {
        _clientFactory = clientFactory;
    }

    public async Task<string> GetDataAsync()
    {
        var client = _clientFactory.CreateClient();
        var response = await client.GetAsync("https://api.example.com/data");
        response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
        return await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
    }
}
```

**Named Clients:**
```csharp
services.AddHttpClient("MyNamedClient", client =>
{
    client.BaseAddress = new Uri("https://api.example.com/");
    client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("Accept", "application/json");
});
```

**Typed Clients:**
```csharp
public class MyTypedClient
{
    private readonly HttpClient _client;

    public MyTypedClient(HttpClient client)
    {
        _client = client;
        _client.BaseAddress = new Uri("https://api.example.com/");
        _client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("Accept", "application/json");
    }

    public async Task<string> GetDataAsync()
    {
        var response = await _client.GetAsync("/data");
        response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
        return await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
    }
}

// Register the typed client
services.AddHttpClient<MyTypedClient>();
```

### 2. Make POST, PUT, and DELETE Requests

#### Overview:
`IHttpClientFactory` can be used to create `HttpClient` instances that perform various HTTP methods such as POST, PUT, and DELETE. These methods are essential for creating, updating, and deleting resources on a server.

#### Key Points:
- **POST:** Sends data to the server to create a new resource.
- **PUT:** Updates an existing resource with new data.
- **DELETE:** Removes a resource from the server.

#### Example:

**POST Request:**
```csharp
public async Task CreateResourceAsync(MyResource resource)
{
    var client = _clientFactory.CreateClient("MyNamedClient");
    var response = await client.PostAsJsonAsync("/resources", resource);
    response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
}
```

**PUT Request:**
```csharp
public async Task UpdateResourceAsync(int id, MyResource resource)
{
    var client = _clientFactory.CreateClient("MyNamedClient");
    var response = await client.PutAsJsonAsync($"/resources/{id}", resource);
    response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
}
```

**DELETE Request:**
```csharp
public async Task DeleteResourceAsync(int id)
{
    var client = _clientFactory.CreateClient("MyNamedClient");
    var response = await client.DeleteAsync($"/resources/{id}");
    response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
}
```

### 3. Outgoing Request Middleware

#### Overview:
Outgoing request middleware allows you to add custom logic to the HTTP request pipeline. This can be used for logging, authentication, retry policies, etc. Middleware is typically implemented as delegating handlers.

#### Key Points:
- **Delegating Handlers:** Custom handlers that can process HTTP requests and responses.
- **Middleware Chain:** Handlers can be added to the `HttpClient` pipeline in a specific order.

#### Example:

**Logging Handler:**
```csharp
public class LoggingHandler : DelegatingHandler
{
    private readonly ILogger<LoggingHandler> _logger;

    public LoggingHandler(ILogger<LoggingHandler> logger)
    {
        _logger = logger;
    }

    protected override async Task<HttpResponseMessage> SendAsync(HttpRequestMessage request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        _logger.LogInformation("Sending request: {Request}", request);
        var response = await base.SendAsync(request, cancellationToken);
        _logger.LogInformation("Received response: {Response}", response);
        return response;
    }
}

// Register the handler
services.AddTransient<LoggingHandler>();

services.AddHttpClient("MyNamedClient")
        .AddHttpMessageHandler<LoggingHandler>();
```

### 4. Use Polly-based Handlers

#### Overview:
Polly is a .NET resilience and transient-fault-handling library. `IHttpClientFactory` integrates with Polly to provide policies such as retry, circuit-breaker, timeout, and fallback for `HttpClient` requests.

#### Key Points:
- **Retry Policies:** Automatically retry failed requests.
- **Circuit Breaker:** Temporarily halt requests when they fail repeatedly.
- **Timeouts:** Enforce time limits on requests.
- **Fallback:** Provide alternative responses when requests fail.

#### Example:

**Retry Policy:**
```csharp
services.AddHttpClient("MyNamedClient")
        .AddPolicyHandler(Policy.Handle<HttpRequestException>()
                                  .RetryAsync(3));
```

**Circuit Breaker Policy:**
```csharp
services.AddHttpClient("MyNamedClient")
        .AddPolicyHandler(Policy.Handle<HttpRequestException>()
                                  .CircuitBreakerAsync(5, TimeSpan.FromMinutes(1)));
```

**Combined Policies:**
```csharp
services.AddHttpClient("MyNamedClient")
        .AddPolicyHandler(Policy.WrapAsync(
            Policy.Handle<HttpRequestException>().RetryAsync(3),
            Policy.Handle<HttpRequestException>().CircuitBreakerAsync(5, TimeSpan.FromMinutes(1))
        ));
```

### Summary:

These subpoints cover various aspects of using `IHttpClientFactory` in ASP.NET Core applications. Consumption patterns include basic, named, and typed clients, each offering different levels of configuration and usage. Making POST, PUT, and DELETE requests is straightforward with `HttpClient`. Outgoing request middleware allows customizing the HTTP request pipeline with delegating handlers. Polly-based handlers integrate resilience and fault-handling policies, improving the robustness of HTTP requests.
