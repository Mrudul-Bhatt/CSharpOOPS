Certainly! Here is an explanation of the article "Static files in ASP.NET Core" in ASP.NET Core, focusing on the points: "How to opt out," "Disclosure," and "Data points."

### 1. How to Opt Out

#### Overview:
Opting out of serving static files in an ASP.NET Core application means disabling the static file middleware or configuring the application to not serve static files.

#### Key Points:
- **Disable Static Files Middleware:** Remove or comment out the `UseStaticFiles` middleware in the `Startup.Configure` method.
- **Exclude `wwwroot` Folder:** You can also exclude the `wwwroot` folder from your project if you don't want to serve any static files.
- **Custom Configuration:** Configure other middleware to handle requests instead of serving static files.

#### Example:
Disabling the static file middleware in the `Startup.Configure` method:
```csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
    // Do not enable static file middleware
    // app.UseStaticFiles();

    app.UseRouting();
    app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
    {
        endpoints.MapControllers();
    });
}
```

### 2. Disclosure

#### Overview:
When serving static files, it's important to understand the potential security implications and disclose any sensitive information that might be unintentionally exposed.

#### Key Points:
- **Sensitive Information:** Ensure that no sensitive files are placed in the `wwwroot` directory or any directory being served as static files.
- **Access Control:** Implement access control measures if certain static files should be restricted to specific users or roles.
- **File Extensions:** Be cautious about serving files with certain extensions like `.cs`, `.cshtml`, etc., that could reveal source code or server-side logic.

#### Example:
Restricting access to certain static files using custom middleware:
```csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
    app.Use(async (context, next) =>
    {
        if (context.Request.Path.StartsWithSegments("/restricted-files") && !context.User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
        {
            context.Response.StatusCode = StatusCodes.Status401Unauthorized;
            return;
        }
        await next();
    });

    app.UseStaticFiles();
    app.UseRouting();
    app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
    {
        endpoints.MapControllers();
    });
}
```

### 3. Data Points

#### Overview:
Data points refer to the various configurable options and settings available when serving static files in ASP.NET Core. These settings allow you to customize how static files are handled and served.

#### Key Points:
- **Middleware Options:** Use the `StaticFileOptions` class to configure various options like content type providers, file providers, and request paths.
- **Content Type Providers:** Customize MIME type mappings using the `FileExtensionContentTypeProvider`.
- **Caching:** Configure caching settings for static files to improve performance.
- **Directory Browsing:** Enable or disable directory browsing and configure its options.
- **Default Files:** Specify which files should be served by default when a directory is requested.

#### Example:
Configuring `StaticFileOptions` to customize static file handling:
```csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
    var provider = new FileExtensionContentTypeProvider();
    provider.Mappings[".myapp"] = "application/x-myapp";

    var options = new StaticFileOptions
    {
        ContentTypeProvider = provider,
        OnPrepareResponse = ctx =>
        {
            ctx.Context.Response.Headers.Append("Cache-Control", "public,max-age=600");
        }
    };

    app.UseStaticFiles(options);
    app.UseRouting();
    app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
    {
        endpoints.MapControllers();
    });
}
```

### Summary:

- **How to Opt Out:** Remove or comment out the `UseStaticFiles` middleware to disable serving static files.
- **Disclosure:** Be cautious about exposing sensitive information and implement access control as needed.
- **Data Points:** Use `StaticFileOptions` to customize how static files are served, including configuring content type providers, caching, and directory browsing.
