### **Service Registration Methods in ASP.NET Core Dependency Injection**

In ASP.NET Core, services are registered into the dependency injection (DI) container using several methods, each tailored for different scenarios. Understanding these methods helps manage the lifecycle and availability of services effectively.

---

### **1. Registering Multiple Implementations**

ASP.NET Core DI container allows you to register multiple implementations of the same service type. However, there are a few things to consider:

- **Registering by Service Type and Implementation Type**: You can register a service by specifying both the service type and the implementation type. This ensures that the container knows which service to resolve when requested.
  
  ```csharp
  services.AddSingleton<IMyDependency, MyDependency>();
  services.AddSingleton<IMyDependency, DifferentDependency>();
  ```

- **Overriding and Resolving Multiple Instances**: If you register multiple implementations of the same service type, the **last registration** will override the previous one when resolved directly by the service type (e.g., `IMyDependency`). However, when using `IEnumerable<T>`, all registered instances are available in the order they were registered.

  ```csharp
  public class MyService
  {
      public MyService(IMyDependency myDependency, IEnumerable<IMyDependency> myDependencies)
      {
          Trace.Assert(myDependency is DifferentDependency); // Resolves the last registered implementation.
  
          var dependencyArray = myDependencies.ToArray();
          Trace.Assert(dependencyArray[0] is MyDependency);   // The first registration
          Trace.Assert(dependencyArray[1] is DifferentDependency); // The second registration
      }
  }
  ```

  In this example:
  - The last `AddSingleton` call resolves as the **default** implementation (`DifferentDependency`).
  - Using `IEnumerable<IMyDependency>` ensures both implementations are resolved in the order they were registered.

---

### **2. Keyed Services**

Keyed services allow you to register multiple implementations of a service type and resolve them based on a **key**. This is particularly useful when you have different implementations of the same interface but need to differentiate between them at runtime.

- **Registering Keyed Services**: Services are registered with a key using `AddKeyedSingleton`, `AddKeyedScoped`, or `AddKeyedTransient`.

  ```csharp
  builder.Services.AddKeyedSingleton<ICache, BigCache>("big");
  builder.Services.AddKeyedSingleton<ICache, SmallCache>("small");
  ```

- **Accessing Keyed Services**: You can resolve a specific service by using the `[FromKeyedServices]` attribute along with the key.

  ```csharp
  app.MapGet("/big", ([FromKeyedServices("big")] ICache bigCache) => bigCache.Get("date"));
  app.MapGet("/small", ([FromKeyedServices("small")] ICache smallCache) => smallCache.Get("date"));
  ```

  In this example:
  - Two `ICache` implementations (`BigCache` and `SmallCache`) are registered with the keys `"big"` and `"small"`, respectively.
  - The services are then resolved in the API endpoint based on the specified keys.

- **Keyed Services in Controllers and Hubs**: You can also use keyed services in MVC controllers, SignalR hubs, or any other class where dependency injection is used.

  ```csharp
  [ApiController]
  [Route("/cache")]
  public class CustomServicesApiController : Controller
  {
      [HttpGet("big-cache")]
      public ActionResult<object> GetOk([FromKeyedServices("big")] ICache cache)
      {
          return cache.Get("data-mvc");
      }
  }
  ```

  In this controller, the `big` key is used to resolve the `BigCache` implementation of `ICache`.

---

### **3. Keyed Services in Middleware**

Middleware can also resolve keyed services, either through constructor injection or within the `Invoke` or `InvokeAsync` methods.

- **Constructor Injection**: You can inject a keyed service into the constructor of middleware.

  ```csharp
  var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
  builder.Services.AddKeyedSingleton<MySingletonClass>("test");
  builder.Services.AddKeyedScoped<MyScopedClass>("test2");

  var app = builder.Build();
  app.UseMiddleware<MyMiddleware>();
  ```

- **Invoke/InvokeAsync Method Injection**: You can also resolve keyed services within the `Invoke` or `InvokeAsync` method, which is important to avoid issues with scoped services in middleware.

  ```csharp
  internal class MyMiddleware
  {
      private readonly RequestDelegate _next;

      public MyMiddleware(RequestDelegate next,
          [FromKeyedServices("test")] MySingletonClass service)
      {
          _next = next;
      }

      public Task Invoke(HttpContext context,
          [FromKeyedServices("test2")] MyScopedClass scopedService) => _next(context);
  }
  ```

---

### **4. Entity Framework Contexts and Service Lifetimes**

Entity Framework (EF) contexts are typically registered with a **scoped lifetime** because database operations are usually scoped to a single request. It's essential to ensure that the lifetime of the database context does not exceed the service's lifetime.

- **AddDbContext**: By default, `AddDbContext` registers EF contexts with a scoped lifetime. If you want to change the lifetime (for example, to singleton or transient), you can do so using the appropriate `AddDbContext` overloads.

  ```csharp
  builder.Services.AddDbContext<ApplicationDbContext>(options =>
      options.UseSqlServer(connectionString), ServiceLifetime.Transient);
  ```

- **Avoid Lifetime Issues**: Ensure that services with a **shorter lifetime** (e.g., singleton) do not depend on a service with a **longer lifetime** (e.g., scoped services like EF contexts), as this can lead to runtime exceptions.

---

### **Conclusion**

- **Service registration methods** in ASP.NET Core allow flexibility in how services are instantiated and injected. Understanding when to use methods like `AddSingleton`, `AddScoped`, and `AddTransient` helps you manage service lifetimes and dependencies effectively.
- **Keyed services** provide a mechanism for registering and resolving multiple implementations of a service type based on keys, which is useful in scenarios where you need to differentiate implementations at runtime.
- When working with **middleware** or **Entity Framework**, pay attention to the service lifetimes and ensure dependencies are resolved correctly to avoid runtime issues.
