### **Registering Groups of Services with Extension Methods in ASP.NET Core**

In ASP.NET Core, it’s common to register related services as a group using **extension methods**. This approach allows for a cleaner and more organized way to configure services and reduce the amount of repetitive code in the `Program.cs` or `Startup.cs` files.

#### **Why Use Extension Methods for Service Registration?**
1. **Organized Configuration**: Instead of cluttering your `Program.cs` with multiple service registrations, grouping them into extension methods keeps things clean.
2. **Separation of Concerns**: You can encapsulate all service-related logic in a dedicated class, making your app easier to maintain.
3. **Reusability**: The same extension methods can be reused across different projects or parts of your application.

### **How It Works:**

#### **1. Framework-Conventions for Grouping Services**

ASP.NET Core uses a convention where related services are grouped under a single `Add{GROUP_NAME}` extension method. For example, the `AddControllers` method registers all services necessary for MVC controllers. Similarly:
- `AddRazorPages` registers services for Razor Pages.
- `AddDefaultIdentity` registers services needed for user authentication with Identity.

#### **Example of Registering Services Using Grouped Methods:**

Here's an example from a Razor Pages application using individual user accounts:

```csharp
using DependencyInjectionSample.Data;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity;
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Register DbContext and Identity services using extension methods
var connectionString = builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection");
builder.Services.AddDbContext<ApplicationDbContext>(options =>
    options.UseSqlServer(connectionString));

builder.Services.AddDatabaseDeveloperPageExceptionFilter();

// Register Identity services
builder.Services.AddDefaultIdentity<IdentityUser>(options => options.SignIn.RequireConfirmedAccount = true)
    .AddEntityFrameworkStores<ApplicationDbContext>();

// Register Razor Pages services
builder.Services.AddRazorPages();

var app = builder.Build();
```

In this example, the services for:
- **Database** (`AddDbContext`)
- **Identity** (`AddDefaultIdentity`)
- **Razor Pages** (`AddRazorPages`)

are registered using respective extension methods.

#### **2. Configuring Additional Services**

You can also group configuration services together. For instance, you can register and configure settings using options pattern like this:

```csharp
using ConfigSample.Options;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.ConfigSample.Options;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Register Razor Pages services
builder.Services.AddRazorPages();

// Register configuration services
builder.Services.Configure<PositionOptions>(
    builder.Configuration.GetSection(PositionOptions.Position));
builder.Services.Configure<ColorOptions>(
    builder.Configuration.GetSection(ColorOptions.Color));

// Register custom dependencies
builder.Services.AddScoped<IMyDependency, MyDependency>();
builder.Services.AddScoped<IMyDependency2, MyDependency2>();

var app = builder.Build();
```

#### **3. Moving Grouped Services to Extension Methods**

You can encapsulate related service registrations into extension methods. This makes your `Program.cs` file clean and modular. Here's how you can create an extension method to register configuration services:

```csharp
using ConfigSample.Options;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;

namespace Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection
{
    public static class MyConfigServiceCollectionExtensions
    {
        // Extension method to add configuration services
        public static IServiceCollection AddConfig(
            this IServiceCollection services, IConfiguration config)
        {
            services.Configure<PositionOptions>(
                config.GetSection(PositionOptions.Position));
            services.Configure<ColorOptions>(
                config.GetSection(ColorOptions.Color));

            return services;
        }

        // Extension method to register custom dependencies
        public static IServiceCollection AddMyDependencyGroup(
            this IServiceCollection services)
        {
            services.AddScoped<IMyDependency, MyDependency>();
            services.AddScoped<IMyDependency2, MyDependency2>();

            return services;
        }
    }
}
```

With these extension methods, you can register services in a more modular way. Now, in your `Program.cs`, you can simply use these methods to register services:

```csharp
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.ConfigSample.Options;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Use the extension methods to register services
builder.Services
    .AddConfig(builder.Configuration)
    .AddMyDependencyGroup();

// Register Razor Pages services
builder.Services.AddRazorPages();

var app = builder.Build();
```

#### **How It Helps**
1. **Simplifies Service Registration**: Instead of repeating the same service configuration across different parts of the code, you bundle them into cohesive units.
2. **Better Maintenance**: If you need to update or modify how services are configured, you only need to change the code in the extension method rather than modifying multiple lines in `Program.cs`.
3. **Promotes Reusability**: You can easily reuse the extension methods in other projects.

### **Service Lifetimes in Dependency Injection**

In ASP.NET Core, services are registered with different **lifetimes** that dictate how they are created and disposed of:

1. **Transient**: A new instance of the service is created each time it's requested.
   - Use for lightweight, stateless services.
2. **Scoped**: A new instance is created per request.
   - Typically used for services that need to maintain state within a single request (like database contexts).
3. **Singleton**: A single instance is created and shared throughout the application’s lifetime.
   - Use for services that do not depend on request-specific data and are stateless.

The **scoped** services are typically used when you need to share an instance across a single request, like a database context.

#### **Using Scoped Services in Middleware**

For scoped services to work within **middleware**, you must be careful. Direct constructor injection in middleware will cause runtime exceptions due to the singleton nature of middleware, so you need to use one of the following approaches:

- **Inject the service into the `Invoke` or `InvokeAsync` method**. 
- **Factory-based middleware** allows scoped services to be correctly injected per client request.

---

### **Conclusion**

- **Extension methods** help organize and group related service registrations, making your `Program.cs` file cleaner and more maintainable.
- By using extension methods like `AddDbContext`, `AddDefaultIdentity`, and custom methods, you can register various services in a modular, reusable manner.
- **Service lifetimes** (transient, scoped, singleton) dictate how services are instantiated and managed. Be mindful of how scoped services are used in middleware to avoid issues.
