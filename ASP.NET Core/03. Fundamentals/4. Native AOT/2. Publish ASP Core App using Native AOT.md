### **Tutorial: Publish an ASP.NET Core App Using Native AOT**

**Native AOT** (Ahead-of-Time compilation) in .NET 8.0 enables applications to be compiled directly to machine code ahead of time, which can improve startup time, reduce memory usage, and provide better overall performance. However, this feature is currently in **preview**, so not all **ASP.NET Core** features are compatible with Native AOT. 

Here’s a step-by-step guide to publishing an **ASP.NET Core app** using Native AOT with both the **.NET CLI** and **Visual Studio**.

---

### **Prerequisites**
- **.NET CLI**
- **Visual Studio 2022** (with Desktop development with C++ workload installed)
- **.NET 8.0 SDK** or later
- **Visual Studio 2022** is required because Native AOT relies on `link.exe` and Visual C++ static runtime libraries.

On **Linux**, specific prerequisites for Native AOT deployment are needed, but they are outside the scope of this guide.

### **Step 1: Create a Web App with Native AOT**

You can create an ASP.NET Core API app that's configured to work with Native AOT using the **.NET CLI** or **Visual Studio**. Below are the steps for using the **.NET CLI**.

#### Using the .NET CLI:
Run the following command to create a new project:

```bash
dotnet new webapiaot -o MyFirstAotWebApi && cd MyFirstAotWebApi
```

The output will indicate the successful creation of the template:

```
The template "ASP.NET Core Web API (Native AOT)" was created successfully.

Processing post-creation actions...
Restoring C:\Code\Demos\MyFirstAotWebApi\MyFirstAotWebApi.csproj:
  Determining projects to restore...
  Restored C:\Code\Demos\MyFirstAotWebApi\MyFirstAotWebApi.csproj (in 302 ms).
Restore succeeded.
```

---

### **Step 2: Publish the Native AOT App**

After creating the application, you can **publish** the app using the **.NET CLI** or **Visual Studio**.

#### Using the .NET CLI:
Run the following command to publish the app:

```bash
dotnet publish
```

The command will:

1. **Compile** the source files.
2. **Generate source code files** that are compiled.
3. **Pass the generated assemblies** to a **native IL compiler** that produces a **native executable** containing machine code.

Example output:

```
MSBuild version 17.<version> for .NET
  Determining projects to restore...
  Restored C:\Code\Demos\MyFirstAotWebApi\MyFirstAotWebApi.csproj (in 241 ms).
  Generating native code
  MyFirstAotWebApi -> C:\Code\Demos\MyFirstAotWebApi\bin\Release\net8.0\win-x64\publish\
```

Check the contents of the output directory:

```bash
dir bin\Release\net8.0\win-x64\publish
```

Example output:

```
    Directory: C:\Code\Demos\MyFirstAotWebApi\bin\Release\net8.0\win-x64\publish

Mode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name
----                 -------------         ------ ----
-a---          30/03/2023  1:41 PM        9480704 MyFirstAotWebApi.exe
-a---          30/03/2023  1:41 PM       43044864 MyFirstAotWebApi.pdb
```

The executable is **self-contained**, meaning it does not require a separate .NET runtime to run. When launched, it behaves the same as it would in the development environment.

#### Running the AOT app:

After publishing, navigate to the `publish` directory and run the app:

```bash
.\bin\Release\net8.0\win-x64\publish\MyFirstAotWebApi.exe
```

Example output when the app starts:

```
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[14]
      Now listening on: http://localhost:5000
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
      Application started. Press Ctrl+C to shut down.
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
      Hosting environment: Production
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
      Content root path: C:\Code\Demos\MyFirstAotWebApi
```

### **Step 3: Libraries and Native AOT**

Many libraries commonly used in **ASP.NET Core** applications are not fully compatible with Native AOT. Some of the issues arise from:

- **Reflection**: Inspecting and discovering types at runtime is incompatible with Native AOT because reflection relies on metadata that may be removed during the trimming process.
- **Conditional loading of libraries at runtime**: Native AOT doesn't support runtime loading of assemblies or types that aren’t explicitly referenced at compile-time.
- **Code generation**: Generating code dynamically at runtime is another feature incompatible with Native AOT.

To resolve these issues, libraries can be updated to work with Native AOT using tools like **Roslyn source generators**. These tools generate code at compile-time, avoiding reflection and enabling compatibility with AOT.

---

### **Encouragement for Library Authors**

Authors of libraries that wish to support Native AOT should:

1. **Read the Native AOT compatibility requirements** to understand the limitations and changes required.
2. **Prepare their libraries for trimming**: This is crucial for reducing the app’s size and ensuring only necessary code is included in the final output.

By adopting these practices, libraries can be made compatible with Native AOT, ensuring that applications built with them are optimized for performance and efficiency.

### **Conclusion**

The **Native AOT** feature in .NET 8.0 enables better performance and smaller application sizes by compiling code directly to native machine code. However, it requires specific configuration steps, including the use of source generators to replace reflection-based functionality and addressing compatibility issues with dynamic libraries. While this feature is in **preview**, it holds great promise for building high-performance, self-contained ASP.NET Core applications.
