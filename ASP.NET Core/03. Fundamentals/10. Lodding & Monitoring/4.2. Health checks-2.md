Sure, let's continue with the next four subpoints from the article "Health checks in ASP.NET Core":

### 1. Health Check Options

#### Overview:
Health check options provide various configurations to customize the behavior of health checks. These options allow you to define how health checks are executed, what fields are included in the response, and how the results are formatted.

#### Key Configurations:
1. **Predicate:**
   - This property allows you to filter which health checks are run based on certain criteria (e.g., tags).

2. **ResponseWriter:**
   - This property allows you to customize the format of the health check response.

3. **ResultStatusCodes:**
   - This property maps health statuses (Healthy, Degraded, Unhealthy) to specific HTTP status codes.

#### Example:
Here's an example of configuring health check options:

```csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
    app.UseRouting();

    app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
    {
        endpoints.MapHealthChecks("/health", new HealthCheckOptions
        {
            Predicate = _ => true, // Run all health checks
            ResponseWriter = async (context, report) =>
            {
                context.Response.ContentType = "application/json";
                var json = JsonSerializer.Serialize(new
                {
                    status = report.Status.ToString(),
                    checks = report.Entries.Select(entry => new
                    {
                        name = entry.Key,
                        status = entry.Value.Status.ToString(),
                        description = entry.Value.Description
                    })
                });
                await context.Response.WriteAsync(json);
            },
            ResultStatusCodes =
            {
                [HealthStatus.Healthy] = StatusCodes.Status200OK,
                [HealthStatus.Degraded] = StatusCodes.Status500InternalServerError,
                [HealthStatus.Unhealthy] = StatusCodes.Status503ServiceUnavailable
            }
        });
    });
}
```

### 2. Database Probe

#### Overview:
A database probe checks the health of a database connection to ensure that the application can successfully communicate with the database. This is crucial for applications that rely on databases for data storage and retrieval.

#### Example:
To set up a database probe, you can use the built-in SQL Server health check or create a custom health check for other databases:

1. **SQL Server Health Check:**
   - Add the necessary NuGet package: `Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks.SqlServer`.

   ```csharp
   public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
   {
       services.AddHealthChecks()
               .AddSqlServer(connectionString: "YourConnectionString", name: "SQL Server Health Check");
   }
   ```

2. **Custom Database Health Check:**
   - Implement a custom health check for other types of databases.

   ```csharp
   public class CustomDatabaseHealthCheck : IHealthCheck
   {
       private readonly string _connectionString;

       public CustomDatabaseHealthCheck(string connectionString)
       {
           _connectionString = connectionString;
       }

       public async Task<HealthCheckResult> CheckHealthAsync(HealthCheckContext context, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
       {
           // Implement your custom database check logic here
           using (var connection = new SqlConnection(_connectionString))
           {
               try
               {
                   await connection.OpenAsync(cancellationToken);
                   return HealthCheckResult.Healthy("Database connection is healthy.");
               }
               catch (Exception ex)
               {
                   return HealthCheckResult.Unhealthy("Database connection is unhealthy.", ex);
               }
           }
       }
   }
   ```

   - Register the custom database health check in `Startup`.

   ```csharp
   public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
   {
       services.AddHealthChecks()
               .AddCheck<CustomDatabaseHealthCheck>("Custom Database Health Check");
   }
   ```

### 3. Entity Framework Core DbContext Probe

#### Overview:
An Entity Framework Core DbContext probe verifies the health of the database connection using the application's DbContext. This ensures that the DbContext can successfully interact with the database.

#### Example:
To set up an Entity Framework Core DbContext probe, follow these steps:

1. **Add the Necessary Packages:**
   - Ensure you have the `Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks.EntityFrameworkCore` package installed.

2. **Register the DbContext Health Check:**
   - Configure health checks to use the DbContext in `Startup`.

   ```csharp
   public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
   {
       services.AddDbContext<MyDbContext>(options =>
           options.UseSqlServer("YourConnectionString"));

       services.AddHealthChecks()
               .AddDbContextCheck<MyDbContext>("DbContext Health Check");
   }
   ```

### 4. Separate Readiness and Liveness Probes

#### Overview:
Readiness and liveness probes are used to determine the operational state of an application. A readiness probe checks if an application is ready to handle requests, while a liveness probe checks if the application is alive and running.

#### Use Cases:
- **Readiness Probe:** Used by load balancers to determine if the application can start accepting traffic.
- **Liveness Probe:** Used by container orchestrators (e.g., Kubernetes) to restart unhealthy containers.

#### Example:
To set up separate readiness and liveness probes, configure different health check endpoints:

1. **Configure Readiness Probe:**
   - Use health checks that verify dependencies and ensure the application is ready.

   ```csharp
   public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
   {
       app.UseRouting();

       app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
       {
           endpoints.MapHealthChecks("/health/readiness", new HealthCheckOptions
           {
               Predicate = (check) => check.Tags.Contains("readiness")
           });
       });
   }
   ```

   - Tag health checks for readiness.

   ```csharp
   public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
   {
       services.AddHealthChecks()
               .AddCheck<CustomDatabaseHealthCheck>("Database", tags: new[] { "readiness" });
   }
   ```

2. **Configure Liveness Probe:**
   - Use health checks that verify the application's basic functionality.

   ```csharp
   public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
   {
       app.UseRouting();

       app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
       {
           endpoints.MapHealthChecks("/health/liveness", new HealthCheckOptions
           {
               Predicate = (check) => check.Tags.Contains("liveness")
           });
       });
   }
   ```

   - Tag health checks for liveness.

   ```csharp
   public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
   {
       services.AddHealthChecks()
               .AddCheck<CustomHealthCheck>("Basic Health Check", tags: new[] { "liveness" });
   }
   ```

By following these steps, you can implement and customize health checks in your ASP.NET Core application, ensuring that the application and its dependencies are healthy and functioning correctly. This setup is crucial for maintaining high availability and reliability in production environments.
