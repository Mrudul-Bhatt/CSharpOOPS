Sure, let's dive into the details of each of these subpoints from the article "Health checks in ASP.NET Core":

### 1. Basic Health Probe

#### Overview:
A basic health probe is a simple way to check the health status of an application. It typically checks whether the application is running and can respond to HTTP requests. This is often used by load balancers and orchestration systems like Kubernetes to ensure that the application is healthy and can handle traffic.

#### Example:
To set up a basic health probe in an ASP.NET Core application, follow these steps:

1. **Add Health Checks Middleware:**
   - In the `Startup` class, configure the health checks middleware.

   ```csharp
   public class Startup
   {
       public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
       {
           services.AddHealthChecks();
       }

       public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
       {
           app.UseRouting();
           app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
           {
               endpoints.MapHealthChecks("/health");
           });
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Access the Health Endpoint:**
   - Once configured, you can access the health endpoint by navigating to `/health` in your browser or using a tool like `curl`.

   ```shell
   curl http://localhost:5000/health
   ```

### 2. Create Health Checks

#### Overview:
Creating health checks involves defining custom logic to verify the health of various components of your application, such as databases, external services, or internal system states.

#### Example:
To create a custom health check, implement the `IHealthCheck` interface:

1. **Define a Custom Health Check:**
   - Create a class that implements `IHealthCheck`.

   ```csharp
   public class CustomHealthCheck : IHealthCheck
   {
       public Task<HealthCheckResult> CheckHealthAsync(HealthCheckContext context, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
       {
           // Perform custom health check logic here
           bool isHealthy = true; // Replace with actual health check logic

           if (isHealthy)
           {
               return Task.FromResult(HealthCheckResult.Healthy("The check indicates a healthy result."));
           }

           return Task.FromResult(HealthCheckResult.Unhealthy("The check indicates an unhealthy result."));
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Register the Custom Health Check:**
   - Register the custom health check in the `Startup` class.

   ```csharp
   public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
   {
       services.AddHealthChecks()
               .AddCheck<CustomHealthCheck>("Custom Health Check");
   }
   ```

### 3. Register Health Check Services

#### Overview:
Registering health check services involves adding the necessary health checks to the dependency injection container. This allows the application to run these checks and report their status.

#### Example:
To register health check services, you need to configure them in the `ConfigureServices` method of the `Startup` class.

1. **Register Built-in and Custom Health Checks:**
   - You can register multiple health checks, both built-in and custom.

   ```csharp
   public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
   {
       services.AddHealthChecks()
               .AddCheck<CustomHealthCheck>("Custom Health Check")
               .AddSqlServer(connectionString: "YourConnectionString", name: "SQL Server Health Check")
               .AddUrlGroup(new Uri("https://example.com"), name: "Example URL Health Check");
   }
   ```

### 4. Use Health Checks Routing

#### Overview:
Using health checks routing involves configuring the application's request pipeline to include endpoints for health checks. This allows external systems to query the health endpoint and determine the application's status.

#### Example:
To set up health checks routing, configure the endpoints in the `Configure` method of the `Startup` class.

1. **Configure Health Check Endpoints:**
   - Map the health check endpoints using `MapHealthChecks`.

   ```csharp
   public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
   {
       app.UseRouting();

       app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
       {
           endpoints.MapHealthChecks("/health");
           endpoints.MapHealthChecks("/health/custom", new HealthCheckOptions
           {
               Predicate = (check) => check.Name == "Custom Health Check"
           });
       });
   }
   ```

2. **Access the Health Check Endpoints:**
   - You can access the health check endpoints by navigating to the specified URLs.

   ```shell
   curl http://localhost:5000/health
   curl http://localhost:5000/health/custom
   ```

By following these steps, you can implement basic and custom health checks in your ASP.NET Core application, register them as services, and configure routing to expose health check endpoints for monitoring and diagnostics. This ensures that your application and its dependencies are healthy and functioning as expected.
