The article "Built-in Metrics in ASP.NET Core" on Microsoft Docs provides a detailed guide on the built-in metrics available in ASP.NET Core and how to utilize them for monitoring and diagnostics. These built-in metrics help developers understand the performance and behavior of their applications without needing to implement custom metrics from scratch. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of the key concepts and steps covered in the article:

### Key Concepts:

1. **Introduction to Built-in Metrics:**
   - ASP.NET Core provides built-in metrics that can be used to monitor the health and performance of applications.
   - These metrics are automatically collected and can be consumed using various tools and libraries.

2. **Types of Built-in Metrics:**
   - The built-in metrics cover various aspects of application performance, such as request rates, response times, error rates, and resource usage.

### Steps to Use Built-in Metrics:

1. **Enable Metrics Collection:**
   - To enable metrics collection in an ASP.NET Core application, you need to configure the appropriate services and middleware.

   ```csharp
   public class Startup
   {
       public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
       {
           services.AddControllers();
           // Add metrics services
           services.AddMetrics();
       }

       public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
       {
           app.UseRouting();

           // Use metrics middleware
           app.UseMetricsAllMiddleware();

           app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
           {
               endpoints.MapControllers();
           });
       }
   }
   ```

2. **View Metrics:**
   - The collected metrics can be viewed using various tools, such as `dotnet-counters`, Prometheus, and Grafana.
   - Metrics endpoints can be exposed for external monitoring systems to scrape and visualize the data.

### Types of Built-in Metrics:

1. **Request Metrics:**
   - Metrics related to HTTP requests, including request rates, response times, and statuses.
   - Examples include `http_requests_total`, `http_request_duration_seconds`, and `http_response_status_codes_total`.

2. **Resource Metrics:**
   - Metrics related to resource usage, such as CPU and memory utilization.
   - Examples include `process_cpu_seconds_total` and `process_working_set_bytes`.

3. **Error Metrics:**
   - Metrics related to errors and exceptions in the application.
   - Examples include `exceptions_throw_total` and `exceptions_throw_rate`.

### Tools for Consuming Metrics:

1. **dotnet-counters:**
   - A performance monitoring tool that can be used to collect and display real-time performance metrics.
   - It can be installed and run using the .NET CLI.

   ```shell
   dotnet tool install --global dotnet-counters
   dotnet-counters monitor --process-id <process-id>
   ```

2. **Prometheus:**
   - An open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit designed for reliability and scalability.
   - Prometheus can scrape metrics from exposed endpoints and store them for analysis.

3. **Grafana:**
   - A powerful visualization tool that can be used to create dashboards from Prometheus data.
   - Grafana can be configured to use Prometheus as a data source and visualize the metrics collected from ASP.NET Core applications.

### Summary:

Built-in metrics in ASP.NET Core provide valuable insights into the performance and behavior of applications. By enabling and configuring these metrics, developers can monitor key aspects of their applications, detect issues early, and optimize performance. These metrics can be consumed using various tools and visualized to provide meaningful insights.
