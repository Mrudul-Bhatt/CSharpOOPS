Sure, let's go through the first four subpoints of the "ASP.NET Core metrics" article:

### 1. Using Metrics

#### Overview:
Metrics are essential for monitoring the performance and behavior of an application. They provide quantitative data that can be used to track various aspects such as request rates, response times, error rates, and resource usage. In ASP.NET Core, metrics can be collected using tools like `dotnet-counters`, and Prometheus, and visualized using Grafana.

#### Key Points:
- Metrics help in identifying performance bottlenecks and understanding application load.
- ASP.NET Core supports various tools and libraries for collecting and visualizing metrics.
- Common metrics include CPU usage, memory usage, garbage collection, and HTTP request metrics.

### 2. Create the Starter App

#### Overview:
To get started with collecting metrics in ASP.NET Core, you first need to create a basic ASP.NET Core application. This involves setting up a new project and configuring it to collect metrics.

#### Steps to Create the Starter App:
1. **Create a New ASP.NET Core Project:**
   - Use the .NET CLI to create a new ASP.NET Core web application.

   ```shell
   dotnet new webapi -n MetricsApp
   cd MetricsApp
   ```

2. **Run the Application:**
   - Run the application to ensure it is set up correctly.

   ```shell
   dotnet run
   ```

3. **Verify the Application:**
   - Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to verify that the application is running.

### 3. View Metrics with dotnet-counters

#### Overview:
`dotnet-counters` is a performance monitoring tool for .NET applications. It can be used to collect and display real-time performance metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, and HTTP request rates.

#### Steps to View Metrics with dotnet-counters:
1. **Install dotnet-counters:**
   - Ensure that you have the `dotnet-counters` tool installed. If not, you can install it using the .NET CLI.

   ```shell
   dotnet tool install --global dotnet-counters
   ```

2. **Run dotnet-counters:**
   - Start the `dotnet-counters` tool to monitor the running ASP.NET Core application.

   ```shell
   dotnet-counters monitor --process-id <process-id>
   ```

   - Replace `<process-id>` with the actual process ID of your running application, which you can find using the `dotnet-counters ps` command.

3. **View the Metrics:**
   - The `dotnet-counters` tool will display real-time metrics in the console, allowing you to monitor various performance aspects of your application.

### 4. Enrich the ASP.NET Core Request Metric

#### Overview:
Enriching metrics involves adding additional context or information to the collected data. In the context of ASP.NET Core, this can mean adding custom tags or properties to HTTP request metrics to provide more detailed insights.

#### Steps to Enrich the ASP.NET Core Request Metric:
1. **Install Prometheus Metrics Middleware:**
   - Add the `prometheus-net.AspNetCore` package to your project to enable Prometheus metrics.

   ```shell
   dotnet add package prometheus-net.AspNetCore
   ```

2. **Configure the Middleware:**
   - In the `Startup` class, configure the Prometheus metrics middleware to enrich the request metrics.

   ```csharp
   public class Startup
   {
       public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
       {
           services.AddControllers();
       }

       public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
       {
           app.UseRouting();

           // Enable Prometheus metrics middleware
           app.UseHttpMetrics(options =>
           {
               options.AddCustomLabel("custom_label", context =>
               {
                   return context.Request.Path; // Example: Add request path as a custom label
               });
           });

           app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
           {
               endpoints.MapControllers();
               endpoints.MapMetrics(); // Expose the /metrics endpoint
           });
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Verify Enriched Metrics:**
   - Run the application and navigate to the `/metrics` endpoint to see the enriched metrics, which now include the custom labels or properties.

By following these steps, you can effectively use metrics in your ASP.NET Core application, create a starter app to collect metrics, view metrics using `dotnet-counters`, and enrich the request metrics to provide more detailed insights into your application's performance. For more detailed information, you can refer to the official article on Microsoft Docs: [ASP.NET Core metrics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/performance/metrics).
