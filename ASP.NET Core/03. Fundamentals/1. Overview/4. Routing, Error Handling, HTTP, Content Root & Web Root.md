### **Routing in ASP.NET Core**

Routing in ASP.NET Core is the process of mapping incoming HTTP requests to specific endpoints within an application. An endpoint could be a **controller action**, **Razor page**, **Blazor component**, or **middleware**.

#### **Routing Middleware**

Routing is handled by middleware added to the request pipeline using the `UseRouting()` method. This middleware interprets the URL patterns of incoming requests and determines which endpoint should handle the request.

- **`UseRouting()`**: This middleware is responsible for processing the URL and matching it to a route. It must be placed before any middleware that requires routing information, such as authorization or endpoint middleware.
  
- **`UseEndpoints()`**: After routing middleware is called, `UseEndpoints()` is used to define the actual endpoints (like Razor Pages or controller actions) that will handle the request.

In an ASP.NET Core application, you typically see routing defined in the **Program.cs** file using methods such as `MapControllerRoute()`, `MapRazorPages()`, or `MapBlazorHub()`. These methods tie routing to their corresponding handler (e.g., MVC controllers or Razor Pages).

#### **Example Routing Configuration:**
```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
var app = builder.Build();

// Enable routing
app.UseRouting();

// Map endpoints (for Razor Pages or controllers)
app.MapControllerRoute(
    name: "default",
    pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");

app.Run();
```
This code maps requests like `/Home/Index` to a specific controller action.

### **Error Handling in ASP.NET Core**

ASP.NET Core provides a range of built-in tools for handling errors, from simple status code pages to advanced developer exception pages.

#### **Key Error Handling Features:**

1. **Developer Exception Page**: Displays detailed exception information, useful during development.
2. **Custom Error Pages**: You can define custom pages to show users when errors occur, such as a 404 page.
3. **Static Status Code Pages**: These are pre-configured pages that show basic HTTP status codes like 404 or 500.
4. **Startup Exception Handling**: Catch and handle exceptions during the application startup process.

#### **Example Error Handling Configuration:**
```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
var app = builder.Build();

// Custom error handling for non-development environments
if (!app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
{
    app.UseExceptionHandler("/Error"); // Redirects to the Error page
    app.UseHsts(); // Enforces HTTPS
}

app.Run();
```

### **Making HTTP Requests with IHttpClientFactory**

`IHttpClientFactory` is a tool in ASP.NET Core that simplifies making HTTP requests while managing the lifetime and configuration of `HttpClient` instances.

#### **Benefits of Using IHttpClientFactory:**

1. **Centralized Client Configuration**: Configure multiple named or default clients, such as a client specifically for accessing GitHub.
2. **Delegating Handlers**: Allows you to create a middleware pipeline for outgoing HTTP requests, such as caching or logging.
3. **Polly Integration**: Provides built-in integration with Polly, a library for transient fault handling (e.g., retries, circuit breakers).
4. **Lifetime Management**: Properly manages the pooling and reuse of underlying `HttpClientHandler` instances, avoiding issues like socket exhaustion.
5. **Logging**: Automatically integrates with logging via `ILogger`, logging HTTP request/response details.

#### **Example of Using IHttpClientFactory:**
```csharp
// Register the IHttpClientFactory in Program.cs
builder.Services.AddHttpClient();

// Use it in your code
public class MyService
{
    private readonly HttpClient _httpClient;

    public MyService(IHttpClientFactory httpClientFactory)
    {
        _httpClient = httpClientFactory.CreateClient(); // Get default client
    }

    public async Task<string> GetDataAsync()
    {
        var response = await _httpClient.GetStringAsync("https://api.example.com/data");
        return response;
    }
}
```

For more details on making HTTP requests with `IHttpClientFactory`, refer to [this guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/http-requests).

### **Content Root and Web Root**

#### **Content Root**

The **content root** is the base directory for the application and its associated files. It includes:

- The executable hosting the app (`.exe` or `.dll`).
- App files (Razor views, configuration files, data files).
- The `wwwroot` folder, which is the **web root** (discussed below).

By default, the content root is the project root directory. You can specify a custom path for the content root when building the host.

#### **Web Root**

The **web root** is the directory where public static files are served. It typically contains files like:

- Stylesheets (`.css`)
- JavaScript files (`.js`)
- Images (`.png`, `.jpg`)

By default, the web root is set to `content root/wwwroot`. You can specify a different path for the web root if needed.

#### **Example of Content and Web Root Configuration:**
```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Specify custom content root
builder.SetContentRoot("/path/to/custom/content");

// Specify custom web root
builder.WebHost.UseWebRoot("/path/to/custom/wwwroot");

var app = builder.Build();
app.Run();
```

#### **Prevent Publishing Files in the Web Root**
In some cases, you might want to prevent certain files or directories in `wwwroot` from being published during deployment. You can configure this using the `<Content>` tag in the project file:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <Content Update="wwwroot\local\**\*" CopyToPublishDirectory="Never" />
</ItemGroup>
```

This configuration prevents files under `wwwroot/local` from being copied to the publish directory.

#### **Virtual Path**
In Razor views, you can use the `~/` character to refer to the web root path. This is known as a **virtual path** and can be used to reference static files in the web root.

```html
<link href="~/css/styles.css" rel="stylesheet" />
```

### **Summary**

- **Routing**: In ASP.NET Core, routing maps incoming HTTP requests to the appropriate application endpoints like controllers, Razor Pages, and Blazor components.
- **Error Handling**: ASP.NET Core provides various tools to handle errors gracefully, including developer pages, custom error pages, and status code pages.
- **IHttpClientFactory**: Manages HTTP clients and provides features like connection pooling, request middleware, Polly integration for transient fault handling, and automatic logging.
- **Content Root & Web Root**: The content root is the base directory for app files, while the web root serves public static files (like JS, CSS, and images) to the browser.

This functionality provides a robust, maintainable foundation for building ASP.NET Core applications with clean routing, error handling, and configuration management.
