Certainly! Let's go through the remaining subpoints from the "Routing in ASP.NET Core" article:

### 1. Short-circuit Middleware After Routing

#### Overview:
Short-circuiting middleware after routing refers to terminating the request pipeline early based on certain conditions after the routing middleware has determined the endpoint. This can be useful for tasks like authorization checks, returning cached responses, or handling specific request conditions efficiently.

#### Key Points:
- **Middleware Positioning:** Middleware that should have the ability to short-circuit requests should be placed after the routing middleware but before the endpoint execution middleware.
- **Short-circuiting:** Middleware can short-circuit the request by not calling the `next` delegate, effectively stopping further processing and returning a response immediately.

#### Example:
```csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
    app.UseRouting();

    app.Use(async (context, next) =>
    {
        if (context.Request.Path == "/short-circuit")
        {
            context.Response.StatusCode = 403;
            await context.Response.WriteAsync("Request was short-circuited.");
        }
        else
        {
            await next();
        }
    });

    app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
    {
        endpoints.MapControllers();
    });
}
```

In this example, if the request path is `/short-circuit`, the middleware sets the response status code to 403 and returns a message without calling `next()`, thereby short-circuiting the pipeline.

### 2. Guidance for Library Authors

#### Overview:
Library authors who develop reusable components or middleware need to consider how their libraries interact with ASP.NET Core routing. Proper integration ensures that libraries work seamlessly with the application's routing configuration.

#### Key Points:
- **Avoid Hardcoding Routes:** Libraries should avoid hardcoding routes and instead provide options for users to configure routes as needed.
- **Use Endpoint Metadata:** Libraries can leverage endpoint metadata to add custom behaviors or requirements.
- **Document Configuration:** Provide clear documentation on how to configure the library within the application's routing.

#### Example:
For a hypothetical logging middleware library:

```csharp
public static class LoggingMiddlewareExtensions
{
    public static IApplicationBuilder UseLoggingMiddleware(this IApplicationBuilder builder)
    {
        return builder.UseMiddleware<LoggingMiddleware>();
    }
}

public class LoggingMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;

    public LoggingMiddleware(RequestDelegate next)
    {
        _next = next;
    }

    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
    {
        // Logging logic here
        Console.WriteLine($"Request: {context.Request.Method} {context.Request.Path}");
        await _next(context);
    }
}

// Usage in Startup.cs
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
    app.UseRouting();

    app.UseLoggingMiddleware(); // Adding logging middleware

    app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
    {
        endpoints.MapControllers();
    });
}
```

### 3. Debug Diagnostics

#### Overview:
Debug diagnostics in ASP.NET Core routing involve tools and techniques for troubleshooting and understanding the routing behavior in an application. Proper diagnostics can help identify routing issues and improve the routing configuration.

#### Key Points:
- **Endpoint Debugging:** Use middleware like `DeveloperExceptionPage` to get detailed error information during development.
- **Route Analyzer:** Tools like `RouteDebugger` can help visualize and analyze route matching.
- **Logging:** Enable detailed logging to capture routing information and diagnose issues.

#### Example:
- **Developer Exception Page:**
  ```csharp
  public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
  {
      if (env.IsDevelopment())
      {
          app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage(); // Detailed error information
      }
      else
      {
          app.UseExceptionHandler("/Home/Error");
      }

      app.UseRouting();

      app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
      {
          endpoints.MapControllers();
      });
  }
  ```

- **Logging Configuration:**
  ```csharp
  public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
  {
      services.AddControllers();
      services.AddLogging(logging =>
      {
          logging.AddConsole();
          logging.AddDebug();
      });
  }
  ```

- **Route Analyzer:**
  - Use third-party tools or custom middleware to visualize routes. For example, the `RouteDebugger` middleware can list all routes and their matching status.

### Summary:

These subpoints provide valuable insights into advanced routing features and best practices for ASP.NET Core applications. Short-circuiting middleware after routing allows for efficient request handling based on conditions. Library authors should ensure their components integrate well with routing configurations. Debug diagnostics, including detailed error pages, logging, and route analysis tools, are essential for troubleshooting and optimizing routing behavior.
