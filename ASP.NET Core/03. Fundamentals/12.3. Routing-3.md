Sure! Let's go through the next four subpoints of the "Routing in ASP.NET Core" article:

### 1. Configure Endpoint Metadata

#### Overview:
Endpoint metadata in ASP.NET Core is used to add additional information to endpoints, which can be utilized by middleware and other components to influence how requests are processed. Metadata can include things like authorization requirements, CORS policies, or custom metadata.

#### Key Points:
- **Adding Metadata:** Metadata can be added to endpoints using attributes or fluent builder methods.
- **Using Metadata:** Middleware and other components can read this metadata to alter their behavior based on the presence and values of the metadata.

#### Example:
```csharp
[Authorize]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class ProductsController : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpGet("{id}")]
    public IActionResult GetProduct(int id)
    {
        // This endpoint requires authorization
        return Ok(new { Id = id, Name = "Sample Product" });
    }
}

// Fluent configuration in Startup.cs
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
    app.UseRouting();

    app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
    {
        endpoints.MapControllers()
                 .WithMetadata(new AuthorizeAttribute());
    });
}
```

In this example, the `[Authorize]` attribute is used to add authorization metadata to the `ProductsController`'s endpoints.

### 2. Host Matching in Routes with RequireHost

#### Overview:
The `RequireHost` method in ASP.NET Core routing is used to restrict routes to specific hostnames. This allows developers to define routes that only match requests with certain host headers, providing greater control over routing based on the request's hostname.

#### Key Points:
- **RequireHost Method:** Use the `RequireHost` method to specify which hosts a route should match.
- **Multiple Hosts:** You can specify multiple hostnames, and the route will match if the request's host matches any of the specified hosts.

#### Example:
```csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
    app.UseRouting();

    app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
    {
        endpoints.MapControllerRoute(
            name: "default",
            pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}")
                .RequireHost("example.com", "www.example.com");
    });
}
```

In this example, the route will only match requests with the host `example.com` or `www.example.com`.

### 3. Route Groups

#### Overview:
Route groups in ASP.NET Core allow you to organize routes into groups with shared configuration. This can simplify route management and ensure consistency across related routes.

#### Key Points:
- **Grouping Routes:** Use `MapGroup` to define a group of routes that share common configuration.
- **Shared Configuration:** Apply common metadata, middleware, or route constraints to all routes in the group.

#### Example:
```csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
    app.UseRouting();

    app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
    {
        var productsGroup = endpoints.MapGroup("/api/products")
                                     .RequireAuthorization();

        productsGroup.MapGet("/{id}", (int id) =>
        {
            return new { Id = id, Name = "Sample Product" };
        });

        productsGroup.MapPost("/", (Product product) =>
        {
            // Handle product creation
            return Results.Created($"/api/products/{product.Id}", product);
        });
    });
}
```

In this example, all routes in the `/api/products` group require authorization and share a common route prefix.

### 4. Performance Guidance for Routing

#### Overview:
ASP.NET Core routing performance can be optimized by following certain best practices. These include minimizing route complexity, using efficient route templates, and understanding the impact of route order.

#### Key Points:
- **Minimize Complexity:** Avoid overly complex route templates that can slow down route matching.
- **Use Efficient Templates:** Prefer simple, straightforward route templates that are easy to parse and match.
- **Order Routes Appropriately:** Place more specific routes before more general ones to reduce unnecessary route evaluations.

#### Example:
- **Simple and Efficient Routes:**
  ```csharp
  app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
  {
      // Specific routes first
      endpoints.MapControllerRoute(
          name: "productDetails",
          pattern: "products/{id:int}");

      // General routes later
      endpoints.MapControllerRoute(
          name: "default",
          pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");
  });
  ```

- **Avoid Complex Routes:**
  ```csharp
  // Complex and inefficient
  endpoints.MapControllerRoute(
      name: "complex",
      pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id:int}/{optionalParam?}/{anotherParam?}");
  ```

### Summary:

These subpoints provide valuable insights into advanced routing features and performance optimization in ASP.NET Core. By configuring endpoint metadata, using host matching, organizing routes into groups, and following performance best practices, you can create efficient and maintainable routing structures for your applications.
