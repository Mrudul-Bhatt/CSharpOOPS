Sure! Let's go over the remaining three subpoints from the "Use HttpContext in ASP.NET Core" article.

### 1. User

#### Overview:
The `HttpContext.User` property provides information about the current authenticated user. It represents the security context for the current HTTP request and includes details such as user identity, claims, and roles.

#### Key Properties and Methods:
- **Identity:** Represents the user's identity, including authentication type and name.
  ```csharp
  var userName = HttpContext.User.Identity.Name;
  var isAuthenticated = HttpContext.User.Identity.IsAuthenticated;
  ```
- **Claims:** A collection of claims associated with the user, which can include information like user roles, email, and other custom claims.
  ```csharp
  var userClaims = HttpContext.User.Claims;
  foreach (var claim in userClaims)
  {
      Console.WriteLine($"Type: {claim.Type}, Value: {claim.Value}");
  }
  ```
- **Roles:** A convenient way to check if the user belongs to a specific role.
  ```csharp
  var isAdmin = HttpContext.User.IsInRole("Admin");
  ```

#### Example Usage:
In a controller action, you can access user information to customize responses or enforce authorization.

```csharp
public IActionResult UserInfo()
{
    if (HttpContext.User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
    {
        var userName = HttpContext.User.Identity.Name;
        var roles = HttpContext.User.IsInRole("Admin") ? "Admin" : "User";
        return Content($"Hello, {userName}. Your role is {roles}.");
    }
    else
    {
        return Content("User is not authenticated.");
    }
}
```

### 2. Features

#### Overview:
`HttpContext.Features` is a collection of feature interfaces that provide access to various HTTP features that might not be directly exposed by the `HttpContext` itself. These features can include items like request trailers, WebSocket capabilities, and more.

#### Key Points:
- **Accessing Features:** You can access specific features using the `Get<TFeature>` method.
  ```csharp
  var requestFeature = HttpContext.Features.Get<IHttpRequestFeature>();
  if (requestFeature != null)
  {
      var originalPath = requestFeature.Path;
  }
  ```
- **Adding Custom Features:** You can also add custom features to the `HttpContext` for use in later middleware or request handling.
  ```csharp
  public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
  {
      app.Use(async (context, next) =>
      {
          context.Features.Set<ICustomFeature>(new CustomFeature());
          await next.Invoke();
      });
  }
  ```

### 3. HttpContext isn't Thread Safe

#### Overview:
The `HttpContext` object is not thread-safe, meaning it should not be accessed concurrently from multiple threads. This is because it is designed to handle a single HTTP request at a time and concurrent access can lead to race conditions and unpredictable behavior.

#### Key Points:
- **Avoid Concurrent Access:** Do not access `HttpContext` properties or methods from multiple threads simultaneously.
  ```csharp
  // Example of incorrect usage
  Parallel.For(0, 10, i =>
  {
      var path = HttpContext.Request.Path; // This can cause race conditions
  });
  ```
- **Async Operations:** When performing asynchronous operations, ensure that `HttpContext` is not accessed after the original request has completed.
  ```csharp
  // Correct usage with async/await
  public async Task<IActionResult> Index()
  {
      var data = await GetDataAsync();
      return Content($"Data: {data}");
  }

  private async Task<string> GetDataAsync()
  {
      // Simulate async operation
      await Task.Delay(1000);
      // Ensure HttpContext is not accessed here if called after the request completes
      return "Sample Data";
  }
  ```

- **Storing Data:** If you need to access data across multiple threads, consider copying the necessary data from `HttpContext` into local variables.
  ```csharp
  public async Task<IActionResult> FetchData()
  {
      var originalPath = HttpContext.Request.Path;
      var data = await Task.Run(() => LongRunningOperation(originalPath));
      return Content($"Processed data for path: {data}");
  }

  private string LongRunningOperation(string path)
  {
      // Perform operation using the copied path
      return $"Processed {path}";
  }
  ```

### Summary:

Understanding how to use `HttpContext` effectively is crucial for handling HTTP requests and responses in ASP.NET Core applications. The `User` property helps in managing authentication and authorization. `Features` provide access to various HTTP capabilities, and understanding that `HttpContext` is not thread-safe is essential for avoiding concurrency issues.
