### **Built-in Middleware in ASP.NET Core**

ASP.NET Core comes with a variety of middleware components, each serving specific purposes. The placement and order of middleware in the request pipeline are crucial to ensure proper functionality and performance. Below is an explanation of each middleware, its purpose, and its recommended placement in the pipeline.

---

### **1. Authentication**
- **Description:** Provides support for authenticating users.
- **Placement:** Before any component that requires `HttpContext.User`.  
  - **Terminal:** For OAuth callbacks, as it processes authentication requests fully.

---

### **2. Authorization**
- **Description:** Provides support for authorizing users.
- **Placement:** Immediately after the Authentication middleware to utilize the authenticated user's identity.

---

### **3. Cookie Policy**
- **Description:** Tracks user consent for cookies and enforces standards like `SameSite` and `Secure`.
- **Placement:** Before middleware that issues cookies, such as:
  - Authentication
  - Session
  - MVC (for TempData cookies)

---

### **4. CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**
- **Description:** Configures how resources are shared across origins.
- **Placement:** 
  - Before any component that uses CORS.
  - **Example:** Place it before `UseResponseCaching` due to a known bug.

---

### **5. Developer Exception Page**
- **Description:** Generates a detailed error page (used only in the **Development** environment).
- **Placement:** First middleware in the pipeline to catch errors early during development.

---

### **6. Diagnostics**
- **Description:** Includes middlewares for handling exceptions, status codes, and default error pages for new apps.
- **Placement:** Before error-generating components.
  - **Terminal:** For unhandled exceptions or serving default pages in new apps.

---

### **7. Forwarded Headers**
- **Description:** Processes headers forwarded by proxies (e.g., `X-Forwarded-For`, `X-Forwarded-Proto`).
- **Placement:** Before components that consume updated request fields like:
  - Scheme
  - Host
  - Client IP
  - HTTP Method

---

### **8. Health Check**
- **Description:** Checks the health of the app or dependencies (e.g., database availability).
- **Placement:** As terminal middleware for requests that match the health check endpoint.

---

### **9. Header Propagation**
- **Description:** Propagates headers from incoming requests to outgoing HTTP client requests.
- **Placement:** No specific placement constraints.

---

### **10. HTTP Logging**
- **Description:** Logs HTTP requests and responses.
- **Placement:** At the beginning of the pipeline to log all requests.

---

### **11. HTTP Method Override**
- **Description:** Allows POST requests to override HTTP methods (e.g., PUT or DELETE).
- **Placement:** Before middleware that consumes the updated method.

---

### **12. HTTPS Redirection**
- **Description:** Redirects HTTP requests to HTTPS.
- **Placement:** Before components that consume the modified URL.

---

### **13. HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)**
- **Description:** Adds an HSTS response header for enforcing secure HTTPS connections.
- **Placement:** Before responses are sent, but after components that modify requests (e.g., `Forwarded Headers`, `URL Rewriting`).

---

### **14. MVC (Model-View-Controller)**
- **Description:** Processes requests for MVC or Razor Pages.
- **Placement:** As terminal middleware if a route matches.

---

### **15. OWIN**
- **Description:** Supports interoperability with OWIN-based apps and middleware.
- **Placement:** As terminal middleware if OWIN fully processes the request.

---

### **16. Output Caching**
- **Description:** Caches responses based on configuration for full server control.
- **Placement:**
  - After `UseRouting`.
  - Before components requiring caching, like `UseCors`.

---

### **17. Response Caching**
- **Description:** Caches responses but requires client-side participation.
- **Placement:**
  - Before components that require caching.
  - Place `UseCors` before `UseResponseCaching`.

---

### **18. Request Decompression**
- **Description:** Decompresses incoming requests.
- **Placement:** Before components that read the request body.

---

### **19. Response Compression**
- **Description:** Compresses outgoing responses.
- **Placement:** Before components that rely on compression.

---

### **20. Request Localization**
- **Description:** Supports localization for handling different cultures and languages.
- **Placement:** Before localization-sensitive components, like MVC.
  - Must be after Routing Middleware when using `RouteDataRequestCultureProvider`.

---

### **21. Request Timeouts**
- **Description:** Configures request timeouts (global or per endpoint).
- **Placement:** After `UseExceptionHandler`, `UseDeveloperExceptionPage`, and `UseRouting`.

---

### **22. Endpoint Routing**
- **Description:** Defines and constrains request routes.
- **Placement:** Terminal if a route matches.

---

### **23. SPA (Single Page Application)**
- **Description:** Handles requests by returning a default page for SPAs.
- **Placement:** Late in the pipeline to allow:
  - Static files
  - MVC actions
  - Other middleware to take precedence.

---

### **24. Session**
- **Description:** Manages user sessions using cookies.
- **Placement:** Before components that require session data.

---

### **25. Static Files**
- **Description:** Serves static files like CSS, JS, and images.
- **Placement:** Terminal if a request matches a static file.

---

### **26. URL Rewrite**
- **Description:** Supports rewriting or redirecting URLs.
- **Placement:** Before components that consume the rewritten URL.

---

### **27. W3C Logging**
- **Description:** Generates server access logs in W3C Extended Log File Format.
- **Placement:** At the beginning of the pipeline.

---

### **28. WebSockets**
- **Description:** Enables WebSocket protocol for real-time communication.
- **Placement:** Before middleware required to handle WebSocket requests.

---

### **Middleware Order Summary**
Proper placement of middleware ensures efficient request handling. For terminal middleware (like `Static Files`, `Health Checks`, `MVC`, etc.), ensure they're placed where they fully process requests. Middleware like `Forwarded Headers` and `HTTPS Redirection` must be ordered logically to ensure other components function correctly.
