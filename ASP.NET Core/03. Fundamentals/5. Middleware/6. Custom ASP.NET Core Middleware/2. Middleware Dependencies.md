### **Middleware Dependencies in ASP.NET Core**

In ASP.NET Core, middleware components can resolve their dependencies from **Dependency Injection (DI)** to handle various services required for processing requests. The principle of **Explicit Dependencies** ensures that middleware should declare all its required dependencies in its constructor so that they can be injected by the DI container.

Middleware is instantiated once for the entire application's lifetime, but it might need services with different lifetimes, such as singleton, scoped, or transient services. Understanding how to handle these dependencies, especially for scoped services, is crucial for writing efficient middleware.

### **Explicit Dependencies Principle**

The **Explicit Dependencies Principle** means that a middleware component should explicitly expose its dependencies in its constructor. This allows the DI container to inject the necessary services when the middleware is instantiated.

Here’s an example of middleware that accepts its dependencies through the constructor:

```csharp
namespace Middleware.Example;

public class MyCustomMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;

    // Constructor that accepts the next middleware and any required dependencies.
    public MyCustomMiddleware(RequestDelegate next)
    {
        _next = next;
    }

    // The InvokeAsync method is where the actual processing happens.
    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext httpContext)
    {
        // Perform some action before passing the request to the next middleware.
        Console.WriteLine("Request starting...");

        // Call the next middleware in the pipeline.
        await _next(httpContext);

        // Perform some action after the request has passed through the pipeline.
        Console.WriteLine("Request completed.");
    }
}
```

### **Per-Request Dependencies in Middleware**

Middleware is typically created once during the application’s startup. However, **per-request dependencies**, such as scoped services, can be injected into the middleware's `InvokeAsync` method. 

Scoped services are created once per request and must be injected into the `InvokeAsync` method directly, as middleware is constructed once at application startup and may not have access to scoped services by default.

To share a **scoped service** between middleware and other components, the service should be added to the method signature of the `InvokeAsync` method. Here’s how to do that:

```csharp
namespace Middleware.Example;

public class MyCustomMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;

    public MyCustomMiddleware(RequestDelegate next)
    {
        _next = next;
    }

    // Scoped service is injected directly into the InvokeAsync method
    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext httpContext, IMessageWriter svc)
    {
        // Use the injected scoped service
        svc.Write(DateTime.Now.Ticks.ToString());

        // Call the next middleware
        await _next(httpContext);
    }
}
```

### **Example with Scoped Services**

Here is an example that shows how scoped services can be injected into middleware, and how those services are registered and used.

1. **Service Interface and Implementation**:

```csharp
namespace Middleware.Example;

public interface IMessageWriter
{
    void Write(string message);
}

public class LoggingMessageWriter : IMessageWriter
{
    private readonly ILogger<LoggingMessageWriter> _logger;

    // Constructor injects ILogger to log messages
    public LoggingMessageWriter(ILogger<LoggingMessageWriter> logger) =>
        _logger = logger;

    public void Write(string message)
    {
        // Write the message using the injected logger
        _logger.LogInformation(message);
    }
}
```

2. **Register Services**:

In `Program.cs` or `Startup.cs`, register the scoped service so it can be injected into the middleware:

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Register the scoped service for IMessageWriter
builder.Services.AddScoped<IMessageWriter, LoggingMessageWriter>();

var app = builder.Build();

// Use the custom middleware
app.UseHttpsRedirection();
app.UseMyCustomMiddleware();

app.MapGet("/", () => "Hello World!");

app.Run();
```

3. **Middleware Extension Method**:

```csharp
namespace Middleware.Example;

public static class MyCustomMiddlewareExtensions
{
    public static IApplicationBuilder UseMyCustomMiddleware(
        this IApplicationBuilder builder)
    {
        // Use the custom middleware with dependency injection
        return builder.UseMiddleware<MyCustomMiddleware>();
    }
}
```

### **Key Concepts**

- **Middleware Constructor**: The constructor of the middleware class should accept all dependencies (such as `RequestDelegate`) that the middleware needs to function. Dependencies are injected by the DI container when the middleware is instantiated.
  
- **Per-Request Dependencies**: Middleware is created once per application lifetime, but scoped services (per-request dependencies) are injected directly into the `InvokeAsync` method. This ensures that each request gets a fresh instance of the scoped service.

- **Scoped Services in InvokeAsync**: Since middleware is instantiated once at startup, scoped services are injected into the `InvokeAsync` method to ensure they are tied to the lifecycle of the request.

- **Service Registration**: Services like `IMessageWriter` are registered in the DI container, ensuring that dependencies are available when the middleware needs them. For scoped services, use `.AddScoped<TService, TImplementation>()` in the service registration.

### **Testing the Middleware**

The following example shows how the custom middleware interacts with the `IMessageWriter` service, which logs a message when processing each request.

- When the request comes in, the `InvokeAsync` method writes a log with the current ticks value (`DateTime.Now.Ticks`) to the log file using `IMessageWriter`.
- The scoped service `LoggingMessageWriter` uses an `ILogger` to log the message, ensuring that the middleware works with the request-scoped dependency.

### **Summary**

- **Constructor Injection**: Middleware should declare its dependencies in the constructor to follow the **Explicit Dependencies Principle**.
- **Scoped Services**: Middleware should accept scoped services directly in the `InvokeAsync` method to tie them to the request lifecycle.
- **DI and Middleware**: Dependencies for middleware can be injected using the constructor or the `InvokeAsync` method. The DI container handles the creation and management of services, ensuring that each request gets the appropriate instance of a scoped service.
