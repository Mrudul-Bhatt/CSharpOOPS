### **VaryByQueryKeys in ASP.NET Core Response Caching**

In ASP.NET Core, the **[ResponseCache]** attribute is used to control response caching behavior for MVC, Web API, or Razor Pages applications. One of the parameters you can set with this attribute is `VaryByQueryKeys`. This parameter is used to control how caching is applied based on specific query string parameters. However, `VaryByQueryKeys` does not correspond to an actual HTTP header, and it specifically requires the **Response Caching Middleware** to function properly.

#### **What is VaryByQueryKeys?**
`VaryByQueryKeys` allows the cache to differentiate responses based on certain query parameters in the URL. This means that responses will be cached separately for different query strings, even if the path of the request is the same. This is useful when the response changes based on the values of query parameters.

For example, if you have a search page that returns different results based on query parameters like `?category=books` or `?category=electronics`, you can cache these responses separately for each category.

### **How VaryByQueryKeys Works**
When using the `[ResponseCache]` attribute, you can set `VaryByQueryKeys` to specify which query parameters should be used to vary the cached responses.

```csharp
[ResponseCache(VaryByQueryKeys = new[] { "category", "page" })]
public IActionResult Search(string category, int page)
{
    // This will cache responses for different values of "category" and "page"
    return View();
}
```

In this example, caching will occur separately for each unique combination of `category` and `page` query parameters.

#### **Without Using the [ResponseCache] Attribute**
When you're not using the `[ResponseCache]` attribute and still want to control caching based on query parameters, you can manually access the **Response Caching Feature** from the `HttpContext.Features` collection.

Here's how you can manually set the **VaryByQueryKeys** for a response:

```csharp
var responseCachingFeature = context.HttpContext.Features.Get<IResponseCachingFeature>();

if (responseCachingFeature != null)
{
    responseCachingFeature.VaryByQueryKeys = new[] { "MyKey" };
}
```

In this example, the middleware will vary the cached responses based on the query parameter `MyKey`. If the query parameter changes, a separate cached response will be stored for that specific value.

Additionally, if you want to cache responses based on all query parameters, you can use `*`:

```csharp
responseCachingFeature.VaryByQueryKeys = new[] { "*" }; // Varies by all query parameters
```

This will cache the response separately for each unique combination of all query parameters.

### **HTTP Headers That Affect Response Caching**

Here are some **HTTP headers** that impact how **Response Caching Middleware** handles caching in ASP.NET Core:

| **Header**            | **Details**                                                                                                                                                    |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Authorization**      | If this header exists, the response is **not cached**.                                                                                                          |
| **Cache-Control**      | Defines caching behavior with directives such as `max-age`, `no-cache`, `public`, `private`, and more. The middleware only caches responses marked as `public`.  |
| **Pragma**             | Used for backward compatibility with HTTP/1.0. The `Pragma: no-cache` header has the same effect as `Cache-Control: no-cache`.                                 |
| **Set-Cookie**         | Responses containing cookies are **not cached**. This can happen in cases like session-based data or TempData in ASP.NET Core.                                |
| **Vary**               | The `Vary` header tells the cache to vary responses based on specific request headers, such as `Accept-Encoding`.                                                |
| **Expires**            | If this header indicates the response has expired (deemed stale), the response is not cached unless overridden by other headers like `Cache-Control`.            |
| **If-None-Match**      | If the cached response matches the provided `ETag`, the response is served from the cache. Otherwise, a `304 Not Modified` response is returned.                |
| **If-Modified-Since**  | If the `If-None-Match` header is absent and the cached response is newer than the provided date, it is returned from the cache. Otherwise, a `304` response is served. |
| **Date**               | The middleware sets this header when serving from cache if it was not present in the original response.                                                           |
| **Content-Length**     | The middleware will set this header when serving from cache if it wasn't present in the original response.                                                       |
| **Age**                | The middleware computes a new value for the `Age` header when serving a cached response, as the original value is ignored.                                      |

#### **Important Notes:**
- **Authorization and Set-Cookie**: These headers prevent caching because responses involving authenticated content or cookies are often user-specific and shouldn't be served from cache.
- **Vary**: This header is especially important when dealing with responses that depend on specific request headers like `Accept-Encoding`. It helps ensure different variants of the cached response are stored for different values of those headers.
- **Cache-Control**: This header plays a central role in controlling how and for how long a response is cached. For example, `Cache-Control: max-age=3600` allows caching for 1 hour, while `no-cache` prevents caching entirely.

### **Conclusion**

The **VaryByQueryKeys** feature in ASP.NET Core's **Response Caching Middleware** is a powerful way to control how cached responses are stored and retrieved based on query parameters. It is particularly useful when responses vary depending on the query string in URLs. While the **[ResponseCache]** attribute makes it easy to set this up declaratively, you can also manually control caching behavior using the **ResponseCachingFeature** when you need finer control over how caching is applied.
