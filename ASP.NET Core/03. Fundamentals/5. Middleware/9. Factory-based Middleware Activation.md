### **Factory-based Middleware Activation in ASP.NET Core**

Factory-based middleware activation in ASP.NET Core offers a more flexible and extensible way to instantiate middleware in the request pipeline. It enables injecting **scoped services** into middleware and provides a stronger typing mechanism compared to the convention-based middleware activation. This approach is useful when middleware requires more complex dependencies or configuration that is available only at the time of the request.

---

### **Key Concepts and Benefits:**

1. **`IMiddlewareFactory`/`IMiddleware` as Extensibility Points:**
   - `IMiddlewareFactory` and `IMiddleware` provide extensibility points that control how middleware is instantiated.
   - These interfaces allow **activation per client request** (scoped services can be injected into the middleware), making it possible to inject dependencies like database contexts (`DbContext`) that should be scoped to the request lifecycle.
   
2. **Strong Typing and Dependency Injection**:
   - Middleware that implements `IMiddleware` is strongly typed, meaning you can define your middleware class with specific dependencies.
   - `IMiddlewareFactory` manages the creation of middleware instances, resolving these dependencies from the application's service container.

3. **Middleware Activation by Convention vs. Factory**:
   - **Conventional Activation**: When middleware is added using the `UseMiddleware<T>` extension method, ASP.NET Core instantiates the middleware by default using its constructor and convention-based activation.
   - **Factory Activation**: If the middleware type implements `IMiddleware`, ASP.NET Core uses `IMiddlewareFactory` to instantiate the middleware, ensuring that the middleware is created with the correct scope and dependencies.

---

### **IMiddleware Interface:**

The `IMiddleware` interface defines middleware for the request pipeline with a single method:

- `InvokeAsync(HttpContext context, RequestDelegate next)`:
   - This method handles incoming requests and returns a `Task` representing the asynchronous operation of the middleware.
   - Middleware can perform operations (e.g., logging, authentication, data processing) and then call `next(context)` to pass the request to the next middleware in the pipeline.

#### Example of Conventional Middleware:

```csharp
public class ConventionalMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;

    public ConventionalMiddleware(RequestDelegate next)
        => _next = next;

    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context, SampleDbContext dbContext)
    {
        var keyValue = context.Request.Query["key"];

        if (!string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(keyValue))
        {
            dbContext.Requests.Add(new Request("Conventional", keyValue));
            await dbContext.SaveChangesAsync();
        }

        await _next(context); // Passing the request to the next middleware
    }
}
```

In the above example, the `ConventionalMiddleware` uses **constructor injection** for dependencies (e.g., `SampleDbContext`). The middleware is added to the pipeline using `UseMiddleware<ConventionalMiddleware>`.

---

### **Factory-Activated Middleware:**

```csharp
public class FactoryActivatedMiddleware : IMiddleware
{
    private readonly SampleDbContext _dbContext;

    public FactoryActivatedMiddleware(SampleDbContext dbContext)
        => _dbContext = dbContext;

    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context, RequestDelegate next)
    {
        var keyValue = context.Request.Query["key"];

        if (!string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(keyValue))
        {
            _dbContext.Requests.Add(new Request("Factory", keyValue));
            await _dbContext.SaveChangesAsync();
        }

        await next(context); // Passing the request to the next middleware
    }
}
```

In this example:
- The `FactoryActivatedMiddleware` implements `IMiddleware` and its constructor accepts `SampleDbContext` as a dependency.
- This middleware will be activated using an **`IMiddlewareFactory`**, which allows injecting scoped services, such as the `DbContext`, per request.

---

### **Extensions for Middleware:**

You can create extension methods to simplify adding middleware to the request pipeline:

```csharp
public static class MiddlewareExtensions
{
    public static IApplicationBuilder UseConventionalMiddleware(this IApplicationBuilder app)
        => app.UseMiddleware<ConventionalMiddleware>();

    public static IApplicationBuilder UseFactoryActivatedMiddleware(this IApplicationBuilder app)
        => app.UseMiddleware<FactoryActivatedMiddleware>();
}
```

- `UseMiddleware<T>` is used to add middleware to the pipeline. The factory-activated middleware will be instantiated using the `IMiddlewareFactory` instead of the default constructor-based activation.

---

### **Limitation:**

You cannot pass additional arguments to the factory-activated middleware through `UseMiddleware`, as this method does not support passing arbitrary parameters at runtime.

For example, this code would **throw a `NotSupportedException`** at runtime:

```csharp
public static IApplicationBuilder UseFactoryActivatedMiddleware(
    this IApplicationBuilder app, bool option)
{
    // Passing 'option' as an argument throws a NotSupportedException at runtime.
    return app.UseMiddleware<FactoryActivatedMiddleware>(option);
}
```

---

### **Middleware Registration in `Program.cs`:**

In the `Program.cs` file, both conventional and factory-activated middleware are registered in the application's request processing pipeline.

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Services.AddDbContext<SampleDbContext>(options => options.UseInMemoryDatabase("SampleDb"));
builder.Services.AddTransient<FactoryActivatedMiddleware>(); // Registering the factory-activated middleware

var app = builder.Build();

app.UseConventionalMiddleware();  // Adding conventional middleware
app.UseFactoryActivatedMiddleware();  // Adding factory-activated middleware

app.Run();
```

- The factory-activated middleware (`FactoryActivatedMiddleware`) is registered as a **transient service**, meaning a new instance will be created for each request.
- The middleware will be resolved using the `IMiddlewareFactory`.

---

### **`IMiddlewareFactory` Interface:**

- `IMiddlewareFactory` is an interface that provides methods to create middleware instances.
- The default implementation of `IMiddlewareFactory` is `MiddlewareFactory`, and it is registered in the service container as a scoped service.

The factory ensures that the middleware instances are created with the correct dependencies and lifecycle management (scoped or transient).

---

### **Summary:**

- **Factory-based middleware activation** in ASP.NET Core allows middleware to be instantiated with scoped dependencies, providing better flexibility and strong typing.
- **`IMiddleware`** is the interface that middleware classes must implement to be activated using the factory.
- **Factory-based activation** is useful for middleware that needs scoped services, such as a `DbContext` for database interactions.
- **Conventional middleware activation** works by default through `UseMiddleware<T>`, while **factory-activated middleware** is resolved through the `IMiddlewareFactory`.
- This approach offers **dependency injection**, **strong typing**, and more control over how middleware is instantiated and configured in the pipeline.
