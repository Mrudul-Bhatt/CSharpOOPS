### **Request Decompression in ASP.NET Core**

Request decompression middleware in ASP.NET Core provides an automatic way to decompress incoming request bodies that are compressed, based on the `Content-Encoding` HTTP header. This middleware simplifies working with compressed HTTP request bodies by eliminating the need to manually handle decompression logic.

---

### **How It Works:**

1. **Decompression of Request Bodies**:
   - When a request includes a `Content-Encoding` header, such as `gzip`, `deflate`, or `br` (Brotli), the middleware automatically decompresses the request body.
   - The `Content-Encoding` header tells the server what type of compression has been applied to the body. For example:
     - `gzip` for Gzip compression,
     - `deflate` for DEFLATE compression,
     - `br` for Brotli compression.
   - The middleware uses the appropriate decompression provider based on this header.
   - The request body is then wrapped in a decompression stream so that it can be read as if it were an uncompressed stream.

2. **Removing the `Content-Encoding` Header**:
   - Once the body is decompressed, the `Content-Encoding` header is removed from the request, as the body is no longer compressed.
   - Requests without a `Content-Encoding` header are ignored by the decompression middleware and proceed as usual.

3. **Decompression at Endpoint**:
   - Decompression occurs lazily — i.e., it happens when the request body is read, typically during model binding in the controller.
   - The request body is not decompressed upfront; it is only decompressed as needed by the endpoint.

4. **Handling Errors**:
   - If the content is invalid or incompatible with the specified `Content-Encoding` (e.g., corrupted or using an unsupported compression method), an exception is thrown:
     - For Brotli, a `System.InvalidOperationException` is thrown if the data is invalid.
     - For Gzip and Deflate, a `System.IO.InvalidDataException` is thrown.
   - If the middleware is unable to decompress the request body (e.g., due to an unsupported encoding or malformed data), it passes the request to the next middleware in the pipeline.

### **Configuration and Usage**:

The following steps show how to enable and configure the request decompression middleware in ASP.NET Core.

#### 1. **Enabling Default Decompression**:

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Add request decompression services
builder.Services.AddRequestDecompression();

var app = builder.Build();

// Use the decompression middleware
app.UseRequestDecompression();

app.MapPost("/", (HttpRequest request) => Results.Stream(request.Body));

app.Run();
```

- **`AddRequestDecompression()`**: Adds the default request decompression service to the application.
- **`UseRequestDecompression()`**: Enables the decompression middleware in the request pipeline.

By default, the middleware supports the following `Content-Encoding` values:
- `gzip` (Gzip compressed data format)
- `deflate` (DEFLATE compressed data format)
- `br` (Brotli compressed data format)

#### 2. **Custom Decompression Providers**:

You can add support for custom decompression types by implementing the `IDecompressionProvider` interface and configuring it in `RequestDecompressionOptions`.

```csharp
public class CustomDecompressionProvider : IDecompressionProvider
{
    public Stream GetDecompressionStream(Stream stream)
    {
        // Implement custom decompression logic here
        return stream;
    }
}

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Services.AddRequestDecompression(options =>
{
    // Add custom decompression provider for 'custom' encoding
    options.DecompressionProviders.Add("custom", new CustomDecompressionProvider());
});

var app = builder.Build();

app.UseRequestDecompression();

app.MapPost("/", (HttpRequest request) => Results.Stream(request.Body));

app.Run();
```

- **`CustomDecompressionProvider`**: This class implements `IDecompressionProvider` and provides a custom decompression stream.
- **`Add("custom", new CustomDecompressionProvider())`**: Registers the custom decompression provider for a specific `Content-Encoding` header value (in this case, "custom").

### **Request Size Limits and Protection**:

To mitigate potential security risks such as **zip bombs** or **decompression bombs** (which could consume excessive resources), ASP.NET Core enforces size limits on decompressed request bodies.

1. **Max Decompressed Body Size**:
   - The maximum size of the decompressed body is capped by the request size limit, which can be configured in various ways:
     - **Endpoint-specific limits**: Use attributes like `RequestSizeLimitAttribute` to define the maximum allowed body size.
     - **Server-level limits**: This is configured globally for the server, using features such as `IHttpMaxRequestBodySizeFeature.MaxRequestBodySize`.
     - **Web server-specific settings**:
       - **HTTP.sys**: Configured via `HttpSysOptions.MaxRequestBodySize`
       - **IIS**: Configured via `IISServerOptions.MaxRequestBodySize`
       - **Kestrel**: Configured via `KestrelServerLimits.MaxRequestBodySize`

2. **Exception on Exceeding Size**:
   - If the decompressed data exceeds the allowed size, an `InvalidOperationException` is thrown to prevent further reading from the stream.

---

### **Security Considerations**:

- **Disabling Request Size Limits**:
   - While it is possible to disable size limits, it poses a significant security risk, especially in scenarios where the body is buffered. Disabling limits can make your application vulnerable to **Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks** due to uncontrolled resource consumption.
   - It’s critical to implement safeguards (e.g., rate limiting, additional validation) to avoid the abuse of unlimited body sizes.

---

### **Summary**:

- **Request Decompression Middleware** in ASP.NET Core automatically decompresses incoming request bodies based on the `Content-Encoding` header (`gzip`, `deflate`, `br`).
- Decompression happens lazily, only when the request body is read, to optimize performance.
- If decompression fails (e.g., due to invalid or unsupported compression data), the middleware passes the request to the next delegate in the pipeline.
- You can add custom decompression logic by implementing the `IDecompressionProvider` interface.
- To protect against decompression bombs, the size of decompressed request bodies is limited, and configurable request size limits are enforced at both the endpoint and server levels.
