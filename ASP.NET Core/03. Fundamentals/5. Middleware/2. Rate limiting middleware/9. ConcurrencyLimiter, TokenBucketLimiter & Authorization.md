### **Limiter with ConcurrencyLimiter, TokenBucketRateLimiter, and Authorization**

This sample illustrates the use of **rate limiters** to manage concurrent and overall request limits for both authenticated (authorized) and anonymous users. It involves:

1. **ConcurrencyLimiter**: Controls the number of concurrent requests.
2. **TokenBucketRateLimiter**: Controls the number of requests over time (rate limiting) using a token bucket approach.
3. **Authorization**: Differentiates rate limits for authenticated and anonymous users.

### **Key Components and Features**

1. **ConcurrencyLimiter for "get" requests**:
   - The **ConcurrencyLimiter** limits the number of **concurrent requests** that can be handled simultaneously. This is useful to prevent resource exhaustion caused by too many simultaneous requests.
   - **`PermitLimit`**: The maximum number of concurrent requests allowed.
   - **`QueueLimit`**: The number of requests that can be queued when the limit is reached.

2. **TokenBucketRateLimiter for "post" requests**:
   - **TokenBucketRateLimiter** is used to control the rate of requests over a given period.
   - It uses a **token bucket** approach where tokens are replenished periodically, and requests can only proceed if tokens are available.
   - A separate partition is created for each **authorized** user and one for **anonymous** users, each having different rate limiting configurations.

3. **Rate Limiting for Authorized vs. Anonymous Users**:
   - **For Authorized Users**: The partition is based on the authenticated user's identity (`httpContext.User.Identity?.Name`).
   - **For Anonymous Users**: A default partition (`"Anon"`) is used when no user identity is found.

4. **Rate Limiter Options**:
   - The rate limit options (such as `PermitLimit`, `QueueLimit`, `TokenLimit`, `ReplenishmentPeriod`, etc.) are configured using **`myOptions`** from the application's configuration.

5. **Rejection Status**:
   - The `RejectionStatusCode` is set to **429 Too Many Requests**, which indicates that the user has exceeded the rate limit.

### **Explanation of the Code**

1. **Define Policy Names and Configuration**:
   ```csharp
   var getPolicyName = "get";
   var postPolicyName = "post";
   var myOptions = new MyRateLimitOptions();
   builder.Configuration.GetSection(MyRateLimitOptions.MyRateLimit).Bind(myOptions);
   ```

   - `getPolicyName` and `postPolicyName` are the names of the rate-limiting policies for **GET** and **POST** requests.
   - `myOptions` holds configuration values for rate limiting (e.g., token limits, queue limits).

2. **Add Rate Limiters**:
   ```csharp
   builder.Services.AddRateLimiter(_ => _
       .AddConcurrencyLimiter(policyName: getPolicyName, options =>
       {
           options.PermitLimit = myOptions.PermitLimit;
           options.QueueProcessingOrder = QueueProcessingOrder.OldestFirst;
           options.QueueLimit = myOptions.QueueLimit;
       })
       .AddPolicy(policyName: postPolicyName, partitioner: httpContext =>
       {
           string userName = httpContext.User.Identity?.Name ?? string.Empty;

           if (!StringValues.IsNullOrEmpty(userName))
           {
               return RateLimitPartition.GetTokenBucketLimiter(userName, _ =>
                   new TokenBucketRateLimiterOptions
                   {
                       TokenLimit = myOptions.TokenLimit2,
                       QueueProcessingOrder = QueueProcessingOrder.OldestFirst,
                       QueueLimit = myOptions.QueueLimit,
                       ReplenishmentPeriod = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(myOptions.ReplenishmentPeriod),
                       TokensPerPeriod = myOptions.TokensPerPeriod,
                       AutoReplenishment = myOptions.AutoReplenishment
                   });
           }

           return RateLimitPartition.GetTokenBucketLimiter("Anon", _ =>
               new TokenBucketRateLimiterOptions
               {
                   TokenLimit = myOptions.TokenLimit,
                   QueueProcessingOrder = QueueProcessingOrder.OldestFirst,
                   QueueLimit = myOptions.QueueLimit,
                   ReplenishmentPeriod = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(myOptions.ReplenishmentPeriod),
                   TokensPerPeriod = myOptions.TokensPerPeriod,
                   AutoReplenishment = true
               });
       }));
   ```

   - **ConcurrencyLimiter** for **GET requests** (`getPolicyName`):
     - Limits the number of **concurrent requests**. For example, if `PermitLimit` is 5, only 5 concurrent requests can be processed at a time. Additional requests will wait in a queue up to `QueueLimit` requests.
     - Requests in the queue will be processed in the order they were added (`QueueProcessingOrder.OldestFirst`).

   - **TokenBucketRateLimiter** for **POST requests** (`postPolicyName`):
     - The rate limiter is applied using a partition for each authenticated user, based on their identity (username).
     - If the user is authenticated, their username is used as a partition key. For anonymous users, the partition `"Anon"` is used.
     - Rate limiting options are configurable (e.g., `TokenLimit`, `ReplenishmentPeriod`, `TokensPerPeriod`).
     - **AutoReplenishment** ensures that tokens are replenished automatically as needed.

3. **Add Policies**:
   - The policies are added to the rate limiter service using **`AddConcurrencyLimiter`** and **`AddPolicy`** methods. These ensure that requests are limited according to the specified parameters.

4. **Handling Rejection**:
   - When the rate limit is exceeded, the `RejectionStatusCode` is set to **429 Too Many Requests**, signaling that the user has hit the rate limit.

### **Testing and Potential Vulnerabilities**

- **Stress Testing**: 
  - Before deploying to production, stress test your application using tools like **Apache JMeter** or **BlazeMeter** to validate your rate limiter configurations. This ensures the application behaves as expected under high load.

- **Vulnerability to DoS Attacks**:
  - **Creating partitions with user input** (such as IP addresses or usernames) could make the application vulnerable to **Denial of Service (DoS) attacks**. 
  - For example, if the partition is based on IP addresses, attackers could use **IP Source Address Spoofing** to bypass rate limiting.
  - **BCP 38 RFC 2827** provides guidelines for mitigating DoS attacks involving IP source address spoofing.

---

### **Summary**

- The **ConcurrencyLimiter** is used to limit the number of concurrent requests, while the **TokenBucketRateLimiter** limits the overall request rate for authenticated and anonymous users.
- Rate limiting policies are defined for both **GET** (concurrency) and **POST** (rate-based) requests.
- **Stress testing** is essential before deploying rate-limited applications to production, and careful consideration is needed to avoid vulnerabilities related to DoS attacks.
