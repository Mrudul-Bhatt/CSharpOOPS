Sure! Let's delve into the remaining three subpoints of the article "Tutorial: Create a minimal API with ASP.NET Core" on Microsoft Docs for ASP.NET Core:

### 1. Prevent Over-Posting

#### Overview:
Over-posting, also known as mass assignment, occurs when more data than necessary is submitted to an endpoint, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities. This section explains how to prevent over-posting by controlling the properties that can be updated.

#### Key Points:
- **DTO (Data Transfer Object):** Use DTOs to define the properties that are allowed in requests, ensuring only intended fields are updated.
- **Model Binding:** Map the request data to the DTO, and then update the model entity with allowed properties.

#### Example:
Creating a DTO to prevent over-posting:

```csharp name=TodoItemDTO.cs
public class TodoItemDTO
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public bool IsComplete { get; set; }
}
```

Updating the PUT endpoint to use the DTO:

```csharp name=Program.cs
todoItems.MapPut("/{id}", async (int id, TodoItemDTO inputTodo, TodoContext db) =>
{
    var todo = await db.TodoItems.FindAsync(id);

    if (todo is null) return TypedResults.NotFound();

    todo.Name = inputTodo.Name;
    todo.IsComplete = inputTodo.IsComplete;

    await db.SaveChangesAsync();

    return TypedResults.NoContent();
});
```

### 2. Troubleshooting with the Completed Sample

#### Overview:
This section provides guidance on troubleshooting common issues by comparing your code with a completed sample. Reviewing a working example helps identify discrepancies and resolve errors.

#### Key Points:
- **Completed Sample:** Examine the provided completed sample code to ensure your implementation matches.
- **Common Issues:** Address common issues such as incorrect routing, missing services, or database connectivity problems.

#### Example:
Access the completed sample code for reference:

```plaintext
You can find the completed sample code on the official GitHub repository: https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/tree/main/aspnetcore/tutorials/minimal-api/samples
```

### 3. Next Steps

#### Overview:
This section outlines the next steps to further develop your skills and enhance your minimal API. It provides resources for learning more about advanced topics and related technologies.

#### Key Points:
- **Advanced Topics:** Explore advanced topics such as authentication, authorization, and testing.
- **Additional Resources:** Utilize additional resources such as official documentation, tutorials, and community forums.

#### Example:
Suggested next steps for further learning:

- **Authentication and Authorization:** Learn how to secure your API with authentication and authorization.
- **Testing:** Explore unit testing and integration testing for your API.
- **Documentation:** Read the official ASP.NET Core documentation for in-depth knowledge.

### Summary:

- **Prevent Over-Posting:** Use DTOs to control the properties that can be updated, preventing over-posting vulnerabilities.
- **Troubleshooting with the Completed Sample:** Compare your implementation with a completed sample to identify and resolve common issues.
- **Next Steps:** Continue learning by exploring advanced topics, securing your API, and utilizing additional resources.
