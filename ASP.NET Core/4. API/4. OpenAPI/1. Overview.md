Sure! Let's delve into the key points of the article "OpenAPI support in ASP.NET Core API apps" on Microsoft Docs for ASP.NET Core:

### 1. Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi NuGet Package

#### Overview:
The `Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi` NuGet package provides functionality to generate and serve OpenAPI (Swagger) documents directly from ASP.NET Core API apps. OpenAPI is a specification for building and describing RESTful APIs, and Swagger is a set of tools built around the OpenAPI Specification.

#### Key Points:
- **Installation:** Add the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi` package to your project to enable OpenAPI support.
- **Integration:** Integrate the package with your ASP.NET Core application to automatically generate OpenAPI documents based on your API endpoints.
- **Customizable:** Customize the generated OpenAPI documents with additional metadata such as descriptions, tags, and version information.

#### Example:
```bash
# Install the Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi NuGet package
dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi --version 7.0.0
```

```csharp name=Program.cs
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Services.AddEndpointsApiExplorer();
builder.Services.AddSwaggerGen();

var app = builder.Build();

// Enable middleware to serve generated Swagger as a JSON endpoint
app.UseSwagger();
// Enable middleware to serve swagger-ui (HTML, JS, CSS, etc.)
app.UseSwaggerUI();

app.MapGet("/hello", () => "Hello World!");

app.Run();
```

In this example:
- The `Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi` package is installed.
- The `AddEndpointsApiExplorer` and `AddSwaggerGen` methods are called to add OpenAPI/Swagger services.
- The `UseSwagger` and `UseSwaggerUI` methods are called to enable Swagger UI for the API.

### 2. Microsoft.Extensions.ApiDescription.Server NuGet Package

#### Overview:
The `Microsoft.Extensions.ApiDescription.Server` NuGet package provides infrastructure for describing APIs in ASP.NET Core applications. It is used internally by the ASP.NET Core framework to generate OpenAPI documents.

#### Key Points:
- **API Descriptions:** The package provides tools for generating API descriptions, which are used to produce OpenAPI documents.
- **Integration:** It is typically used in conjunction with other OpenAPI-related packages to generate comprehensive API documentation.
- **Internal Use:** While it can be used directly, it is more commonly used as part of other higher-level packages like `Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi`.

#### Example:
```bash
# Install the Microsoft.Extensions.ApiDescription.Server NuGet package
dotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.ApiDescription.Server --version 7.0.0
```

```csharp name=Program.cs
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Services.AddEndpointsApiExplorer();
builder.Services.AddSwaggerGen();

var app = builder.Build();

app.UseSwagger();
app.UseSwaggerUI();

app.MapGet("/hello", () => "Hello World!");

app.Run();
```

In this example:
- The `Microsoft.Extensions.ApiDescription.Server` package is installed.
- The package works behind the scenes to generate API descriptions, which are then used to produce OpenAPI documents.

### 3. ASP.NET Core OpenAPI Source Code on GitHub

#### Overview:
The source code for ASP.NET Core's OpenAPI support is available on GitHub. This allows developers to explore the implementation details, contribute to the project, or customize it to fit their needs.

#### Key Points:
- **Open Source:** The OpenAPI support in ASP.NET Core is open source, allowing for transparency and community contributions.
- **Repository:** The source code is hosted in the aspnet/AspNetCore repository on GitHub.
- **Customization:** Developers can fork the repository, make changes, and submit pull requests to contribute to the project.

#### Example:
To explore the source code for ASP.NET Core's OpenAPI support, visit the official GitHub repository:
[aspnet/AspNetCore](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore)

You can navigate to the relevant directories to view the implementation of OpenAPI support:
- `src/Middleware/Diagnostics/src/`
- `src/Middleware/Diagnostics/Extensions/`

### Summary:

- **Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi NuGet Package:** Provides functionality to generate and serve OpenAPI (Swagger) documents directly from ASP.NET Core API apps. It is customizable and integrates seamlessly with ASP.NET Core.
- **Microsoft.Extensions.ApiDescription.Server NuGet Package:** Provides infrastructure for describing APIs in ASP.NET Core applications, used internally to generate OpenAPI documents.
- **ASP.NET Core OpenAPI Source Code on GitHub:** The source code is open source and available on GitHub, allowing developers to explore, contribute, and customize the implementation.
