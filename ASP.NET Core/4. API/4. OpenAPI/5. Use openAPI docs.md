Sure! Let's delve into the first three subpoints of the article "Use OpenAPI documents" on Microsoft Docs for ASP.NET Core:

### 1. Use Swagger UI for Local Ad-Hoc Testing

#### Overview:
Swagger UI is a powerful tool that provides a web-based interface for interacting with and testing your API endpoints. It automatically generates a user-friendly interface from the OpenAPI document, allowing developers to test the API without needing to write any client code.

#### Key Points:
- **Interactive Documentation:** Swagger UI provides an interactive documentation interface where you can explore and execute API endpoints directly from the browser.
- **Local Testing:** It is useful for local ad-hoc testing during development, allowing developers to quickly test API endpoints and see the responses.
- **Configuration:** Integrate Swagger UI into your ASP.NET Core project by adding the necessary services and middleware.

#### Example:
```csharp name=Program.cs
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Add services to the container
builder.Services.AddEndpointsApiExplorer();
builder.Services.AddSwaggerGen();

var app = builder.Build();

// Configure the HTTP request pipeline
if (app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
{
    app.UseSwagger();
    app.UseSwaggerUI(c =>
    {
        c.SwaggerEndpoint("/swagger/v1/swagger.json", "My API V1");
    });
}

app.MapGet("/weather", () =>
{
    return Results.Ok(new WeatherForecast[]
    {
        new WeatherForecast { Date = DateTime.Now, TemperatureC = 25, Summary = "Warm" }
    });
})
.WithName("GetWeather")
.WithTags("Weather");

app.Run();

public record WeatherForecast
{
    public DateTime Date { get; set; }
    public int TemperatureC { get; set; }
    public string? Summary { get; set; }
}
```

In this example:
- Swagger UI is configured to be available only in the development environment.
- The `UseSwagger` and `UseSwaggerUI` methods are called to enable Swagger UI.
- The `SwaggerEndpoint` method specifies the endpoint for the generated OpenAPI document.

### 2. Use Scalar for Interactive API Documentation

#### Overview:
Scalar provides a graphical user interface for exploring and interacting with APIs based on the OpenAPI specification. It offers a more advanced and customizable experience compared to Swagger UI.

#### Key Points:
- **Advanced Features:** Scalar provides advanced features for interactive API documentation, such as custom themes, advanced search capabilities, and better support for large APIs.
- **Customization:** It allows for extensive customization of the documentation interface to match your branding and requirements.
- **Integration:** Integrate Scalar into your ASP.NET Core project to enhance the API documentation experience.

#### Example:
To integrate Scalar, follow these steps:
1. Install Scalar as a development dependency.
2. Generate the OpenAPI document using Swagger.
3. Serve the Scalar UI with the generated OpenAPI document.

```bash
# Install Scalar as a development dependency
npm install @scalarlabs/scalar --save-dev
```

```bash
# Generate the OpenAPI document using Swagger
dotnet swagger tofile --output ./swagger/v1/swagger.json ./bin/Debug/net7.0/YourApi.dll v1
```

```json name=scalar.config.json
{
    "swagger": [
        {
            "url": "/swagger/v1/swagger.json",
            "name": "My API V1"
        }
    ]
}
```

```bash
# Serve the Scalar UI
npx scalar serve --config scalar.config.json --port 5001
```

In this example:
- Scalar is installed as a development dependency.
- The OpenAPI document is generated using the Swagger CLI.
- Scalar is configured to serve the OpenAPI document and provide an interactive UI.

### 3. Lint Generated OpenAPI Documents with Spectral

#### Overview:
Spectral is an open-source tool for linting and validating OpenAPI documents. It helps ensure that your OpenAPI documents adhere to best practices and standards, catching potential issues early.

#### Key Points:
- **Linting:** Spectral provides a set of rules to lint OpenAPI documents, checking for common issues and ensuring consistency.
- **Custom Rules:** You can define custom rules to enforce specific guidelines and standards for your API documentation.
- **Integration:** Integrate Spectral into your development workflow to automatically lint OpenAPI documents and catch issues before they become problems.

#### Example:
```bash
# Install Spectral as a development dependency
npm install @stoplight/spectral-cli --save-dev
```

```yaml name=.spectral.yaml
extends: spectral:oas
rules:
  info-contact:
    description: "Info object should contain contact information"
    recommended: true
    given: "$.info"
    then:
      field: contact
      function: truthy
```

```bash
# Lint the OpenAPI document using Spectral
npx spectral lint ./swagger/v1/swagger.json
```

In this example:
- Spectral is installed as a development dependency.
- A custom rule is defined in the `.spectral.yaml` configuration file to enforce that the `info` object contains contact information.
- The `spectral lint` command is used to lint the OpenAPI document and check for issues.

### Summary:

- **Use Swagger UI for Local Ad-Hoc Testing:** Integrate Swagger UI into your ASP.NET Core project to provide an interactive documentation interface for local testing during development.
- **Use Scalar for Interactive API Documentation:** Use Scalar to provide a more advanced and customizable interactive documentation interface for your APIs, with features like custom themes and advanced search capabilities.
- **Lint Generated OpenAPI Documents with Spectral:** Integrate Spectral into your development workflow to lint and validate OpenAPI documents, ensuring adherence to best practices and standards.
