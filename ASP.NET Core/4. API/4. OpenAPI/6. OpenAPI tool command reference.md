Sure! Let's delve into the key points of the article ".NET OpenAPI tool command reference and installation" on Microsoft Docs for ASP.NET Core:

### 1. Installation

#### Overview:
The .NET OpenAPI tool is a command-line tool that helps integrate OpenAPI specifications into .NET projects. Before using the tool, it needs to be installed globally on your development environment.

#### Key Points:
- **Global Installation:** The tool is installed globally using the .NET CLI, making it available for use in any .NET project.
- **Version Specification:** You can specify the version of the tool to install, or simply install the latest version.
- **Command:** Use the `dotnet tool install` command to install the tool.

#### Example:
```bash
# Install the .NET OpenAPI tool globally
dotnet tool install -g Microsoft.dotnet-openapi
```

In this example:
- The `.NET OpenAPI tool` is installed globally using the `dotnet tool install -g` command.

### 2. Add

#### Overview:
The `add` command is used to add an OpenAPI reference to a .NET project. This command downloads the OpenAPI specification and generates client code or server stubs based on the specification.

#### Key Points:
- **OpenAPI Reference:** Adds an OpenAPI reference to the project, which can be a URL or a local file path.
- **Code Generation:** The command generates client code or server stubs based on the OpenAPI specification.
- **Options:** Various options are available to customize the behavior, such as specifying the namespace for generated code and choosing the output directory.

#### Example:
```bash
# Add an OpenAPI reference from a URL
dotnet openapi add url https://example.com/swagger/v1/swagger.json

# Add an OpenAPI reference from a local file
dotnet openapi add file ./swagger/v1/swagger.json
```

In this example:
- The `dotnet openapi add url` command adds an OpenAPI reference from a URL.
- The `dotnet openapi add file` command adds an OpenAPI reference from a local file.

### 3. Remove

#### Overview:
The `remove` command is used to remove an OpenAPI reference from a .NET project. This command deletes the previously added reference and cleans up any generated files.

#### Key Points:
- **OpenAPI Reference Removal:** Removes the specified OpenAPI reference from the project.
- **Cleanup:** Deletes any generated files associated with the removed reference.
- **Command Usage:** The command requires the name of the OpenAPI reference to be removed.

#### Example:
```bash
# Remove an OpenAPI reference by name
dotnet openapi remove <reference-name>
```

In this example:
- The `dotnet openapi remove` command removes the specified OpenAPI reference from the project.

### 4. Refresh

#### Overview:
The `refresh` command is used to update an existing OpenAPI reference in a .NET project. This command re-downloads the OpenAPI specification and regenerates the client code or server stubs.

#### Key Points:
- **Update Reference:** Refreshes the specified OpenAPI reference to ensure it is up-to-date with the latest version of the specification.
- **Regenerate Code:** Regenerates the client code or server stubs based on the updated specification.
- **Command Usage:** The command requires the name of the OpenAPI reference to be refreshed.

#### Example:
```bash
# Refresh an OpenAPI reference by name
dotnet openapi refresh <reference-name>
```

In this example:
- The `dotnet openapi refresh` command updates the specified OpenAPI reference and regenerates the associated code.

### Summary:

- **Installation:** Install the .NET OpenAPI tool globally using the `dotnet tool install -g` command.
- **Add:** Use the `dotnet openapi add` command to add an OpenAPI reference to a .NET project, specifying a URL or local file path.
- **Remove:** Use the `dotnet openapi remove` command to remove an OpenAPI reference from a .NET project, cleaning up any generated files.
- **Refresh:** Use the `dotnet openapi refresh` command to update an existing OpenAPI reference and regenerate the associated code.
