Hereâ€™s a structured breakdown of the article **"Host and deploy ASP.NET Core"** from Microsoft Docs, explained by key points:  

---

## **1. Overview of Hosting and Deployment**  
- Hosting an **ASP.NET Core** app involves running it on a **web server** and making it accessible to users.  
- Deployment refers to **publishing and setting up** the app in a production environment.  
- ASP.NET Core supports **cross-platform** deployment on **Windows, Linux, and macOS**.  

---

## **2. Hosting Models**  
ASP.NET Core supports **two hosting models**:  

### **a) In-process hosting (IIS only, recommended for Windows)**  
- The app runs **inside IIS worker process (`w3wp.exe`)**.  
- Offers **better performance** compared to out-of-process hosting.  

### **b) Out-of-process hosting (Cross-platform, Kestrel-based)**  
- Uses **Kestrel** as the web server and **IIS, Nginx, or Apache** as a reverse proxy.  
- Works on **Windows, Linux, and macOS**.  

---

## **3. Web Servers for ASP.NET Core**  
ASP.NET Core apps can be hosted using different web servers:  

### **a) Kestrel (Default Web Server in ASP.NET Core)**  
- Lightweight, high-performance web server.  
- Used for **production and development**.  
- Can be run as a **standalone server** or **behind a reverse proxy**.  

### **b) IIS (For Windows Hosting)**  
- Uses **in-process or out-of-process** hosting.  
- Works with **IIS Express** for development.  
- Supports **Windows Authentication** and **automatic restarts**.  

### **c) Nginx (For Linux Hosting)**  
- Acts as a **reverse proxy** in front of Kestrel.  
- Commonly used in **Linux-based production environments**.  

### **d) Apache (For Linux Hosting)**  
- Like Nginx, Apache can serve as a **reverse proxy** to Kestrel.  
- Configured using **mod_proxy** module.  

---

## **4. Deployment Options**  
ASP.NET Core applications can be deployed using different methods:  

### **a) Framework-Dependent Deployment (FDD)**  
- The app **depends on the installed .NET Runtime** on the server.  
- **Smaller size** but requires the target machine to have the **correct .NET version** installed.  

### **b) Self-Contained Deployment (SCD)**  
- Includes **.NET Runtime and libraries** inside the package.  
- **Larger in size**, but doesnâ€™t require .NET installed on the server.  
- Useful for **deploying to machines that don't have .NET installed**.  

### **c) Docker Deployment**  
- Packages the app into a **Docker container**.  
- Works across different platforms **without modification**.  
- Example `Dockerfile` for ASP.NET Core:  
  ```dockerfile
  FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:8.0
  COPY . /app
  WORKDIR /app
  ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "MyApp.dll"]
  ```  

### **d) Cloud Deployment (Azure, AWS, Google Cloud, etc.)**  
- **Azure App Service**: Simplifies hosting with automatic scaling.  
- **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**: Deploys and manages web apps in AWS.  
- **Google Cloud Run**: Runs apps in a serverless environment.

## **5. Hosting an ASP.NET Core App on IIS**  
1. **Install the .NET Core Hosting Bundle** on the Windows Server.  
2. **Publish the application** using the `dotnet publish` command:  
   ```bash
   dotnet publish -c Release -o ./publish
   ```  
3. **Configure IIS**:  
   - Add a new **website** in IIS Manager.  
   - Point it to the **publish folder**.  
   - Set **Application Pool** to use **No Managed Code**.  
4. **Enable the ASP.NET Core Module** to allow IIS to forward requests to Kestrel.  

---

## **6. Hosting an ASP.NET Core App on Linux with Nginx**  
1. **Install .NET Runtime on the server**.  
2. **Publish the app** using:  
   ```bash
   dotnet publish -c Release -o /var/www/myapp
   ```  
3. **Configure Nginx as a reverse proxy** by editing `/etc/nginx/sites-available/default`:  
   ```nginx
   server {
       listen 80;
       location / {
           proxy_pass http://localhost:5000;
           proxy_set_header Host $host;
           proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
       }
   }
   ```  
4. **Restart Nginx** to apply changes:  
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart nginx
   ```  
5. **Run the app on Linux:**  
   ```bash
   dotnet /var/www/myapp/MyApp.dll
   ```  

---

## **7. Deployment Strategies**  
### **a) Manual Deployment**  
- Copy the published files to the server manually.  
- Start the app using `dotnet MyApp.dll`.  

### **b) Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**  
- Automates deployment using **GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, or Jenkins**.  
- Example GitHub Action for ASP.NET Core:  
  ```yaml
  name: Deploy to Azure
  on: push
  jobs:
    build:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        - name: Setup .NET
          uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v1
          with:
            dotnet-version: '8.0'
        - name: Publish
          run: dotnet publish -c Release -o ./publish
        - name: Deploy to Azure
          uses: azure/webapps-deploy@v2
          with:
            app-name: 'myapp'
            publish-profile: ${{ secrets.AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE }}
            package: ./publish
  ```  

---

## **8. Environment Variables for Deployment**  
- Environment variables can be used to **configure** the app in production.  
- Example `appsettings.Production.json`:  
  ```json
  {
    "Logging": {
      "LogLevel": {
        "Default": "Warning"
      }
    }
  }
  ```  
- Set environment in **Linux**:  
  ```bash
  export ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Production
  ```  
- Set environment in **Windows (PowerShell)**:  
  ```powershell
  $env:ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT="Production"
  ```  

---

## **9. Scaling an ASP.NET Core App**  
### **a) Vertical Scaling (Scaling Up)**  
- Increase **CPU, RAM, or Disk Space** on the server.  
- Limited by **hardware capacity**.  

### **b) Horizontal Scaling (Scaling Out)**  
- Run **multiple instances** of the app behind a **load balancer**.  
- Example **Azure Load Balancer** distributes traffic across instances.  

### **c) Auto-Scaling**  
- Cloud providers like **Azure and AWS** offer **auto-scaling** based on traffic.  
- Example **Azure App Service Scaling**:  
  ```bash
  az appservice plan update --name MyPlan --resource-group MyResourceGroup --number-of-workers 3
  ```
