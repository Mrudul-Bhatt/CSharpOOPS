### When to Use Kestrel with a Reverse Proxy

The article "When to use a reverse proxy with the ASP.NET Core Kestrel web server" provides detailed information on scenarios where a reverse proxy should be used with Kestrel. Here are the key points explained:

#### 1. Reverse Proxy Server Overview

- **Definition:**
  - A reverse proxy server receives HTTP requests from the network and forwards them to Kestrel.
  
- **Examples of Reverse Proxy Servers:**
  - [Internet Information Services (IIS)](https://www.iis.net/)
  - [Nginx](https://nginx.org)
  - [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/)
  - [YARP: Yet Another Reverse Proxy](https://dotnet.github.io/yarp/)

#### 2. Kestrel as an Edge Server

- **Direct Connection:**
  - Kestrel can be used as an edge (Internet-facing) web server, meaning it communicates directly with the Internet without a reverse proxy server.

#### 3. Kestrel with a Reverse Proxy

- **Proxy Configuration:**
  - Kestrel can also be used in a reverse proxy configuration, where it communicates indirectly with the Internet through a reverse proxy server like IIS, Nginx, or Apache.

```

- **Supported Configurations:**
  - Both configurations, with or without a reverse proxy server, are supported hosting configurations.

#### 4. Limitations of Kestrel without a Reverse Proxy

- **IP Address and Port Sharing:**
  - When Kestrel is used as an edge server without a reverse proxy, sharing of the same IP address and port among multiple processes is unsupported.
  - When Kestrel is configured to listen on a port, it handles all traffic for that port and IP address combination.

#### 5. Benefits of Using a Reverse Proxy

- **Public Surface Area Limitation:**
  - A reverse proxy can limit the exposed public surface area of the apps it hosts.

- **Additional Layer of Security:**
  - Provides an additional layer of configuration and defense-in-depth cybersecurity.

- **Infrastructure Integration:**
  - Might integrate better with existing infrastructure.

- **Simplified Load Balancing and HTTPS:**
  - Simplifies load balancing and secure communication (HTTPS) configuration. Only the reverse proxy server requires the X.509 certificate for the public domain(s), and it can communicate with the apps on the internal network using HTTP.

#### 6. Host Filtering Requirement

- **Security Warning:**
  - Hosting in a reverse proxy configuration requires [host filtering](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/servers/kestrel/host-filtering) to ensure that only valid host headers are accepted.

#### 7. Additional Resources
