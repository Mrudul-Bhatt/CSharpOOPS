### Host Filtering with ASP.NET Core Kestrel Web Server

The article "Host filtering with ASP.NET Core Kestrel web server" provides detailed information on using host filtering in Kestrel. Here are the key points explained:

#### 1. Host Name Configuration in Kestrel

- **Prefix Configuration:**
  - Kestrel supports configuration based on prefixes such as `http://example.com:5000`.
  
- **Host Name Handling:**
  - Kestrel largely ignores the host name. The host `localhost` is a special case used for binding to loopback addresses.

#### 2. Host Filtering Middleware

- **Purpose:**
  - As a workaround to the host name handling limitation, Host Filtering Middleware is used.

- **Default Builder:**
  - The middleware is added by `Microsoft.AspNetCore.WebHost.CreateDefaultBuilder`, which calls `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.HostFilteringServicesExtensions.UseHostFiltering`.

```csharp name=Program.cs
public static IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder(string[] args) =>
    Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
        .ConfigureWebHostDefaults(webBuilder =>
        {
            webBuilder.UseStartup<Startup>();
            webBuilder.UseHostFiltering();
        });
```

#### 3. Enabling Host Filtering Middleware

- **Default State:**
  - Host Filtering Middleware is disabled by default.

- **Enabling Middleware:**
  - To enable the middleware, define an `AllowedHosts` key in `appsettings.json` or `appsettings.{Environment}.json`.

```json name=appsettings.json
{
  "AllowedHosts": "example.com;localhost"
}
```

- **Allowed Hosts Format:**
  - The value of `AllowedHosts` is a semicolon-delimited list of allowed host names.

#### 4. Forwarded Headers Middleware

- **Interaction with Forwarded Headers Middleware:**
  - Forwarded Headers Middleware also has an `AllowedHosts` option (`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.ForwardedHeadersOptions.AllowedHosts`).

- **Usage Note:**
  - The `AllowedHosts` option in Forwarded Headers Middleware is separate from the Host Filtering Middleware configuration.

- **Additional Information:**
  - For more details on Forwarded Headers Middleware, see the article on [proxy and load balancer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/proxy-load-balancer).

### Summary

Host Filtering Middleware is an essential component for managing host names in Kestrel, especially when Kestrel is used without a reverse proxy. This middleware allows you to specify which host names are allowed, enhancing security and control over your web application's accessibility.
