### Use HTTP/3 with the ASP.NET Core Kestrel Web Server

The article "Use HTTP/3 with the ASP.NET Core Kestrel web server" provides detailed information on using HTTP/3 with Kestrel. Here are the key points explained:

#### 1. HTTP/3 Requirements

HTTP/3 has different requirements depending on the operating system. If the platform that Kestrel is running on doesn't meet all the requirements, HTTP/3 is disabled, and Kestrel falls back to HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2.

##### Windows

- **Operating System:**
  - Windows 11 Build 22000 or later.
  - Windows Server 2022.
- **Connection Requirements:**
  - TLS 1.3 or later connection.

##### Linux

- **Library Requirement:**
  - `libmsquic` package installed.
- **Installation Steps:**
  1. Add the `packages.microsoft.com` repository. See [Linux Software Repository for Microsoft Products](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/linux-package-repository-for-microsoft-software) for instructions.
  2. Install the `libmsquic` package using the distro's package manager. For example, `apt install libmsquic=1.9*` on Ubuntu.
- **Compatibility Note:**
  - .NET 6 is only compatible with the 1.9.x versions of `libmsquic`. Libmsquic 2.x is not compatible due to breaking changes. Libmsquic receives updates to 1.9.x when needed to incorporate security fixes and other critical changes.

##### macOS

- **Current Status:**
  - HTTP/3 isn't currently supported on macOS and may be available in a future release.

#### 2. Getting Started

##### Enabling HTTP/3:
HTTP/3 is not enabled by default. Configuration must be added to `Program.cs` to enable HTTP/3.

```csharp name=Program.cs
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.WebHost.ConfigureKestrel(serverOptions =>
{
    serverOptions.ListenAnyIP(5001, listenOptions =>
    {
        listenOptions.Protocols = HttpProtocols.Http1AndHttp2AndHttp3;
        listenOptions.UseHttps();
    });
});
var app = builder.Build();
app.Run();
```

- **Port Configuration:**
  - The preceding code configures port 5001 to use HTTP/3 alongside HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 by specifying `HttpProtocols.Http1AndHttp2AndHttp3`.
  - HTTPS is enabled with `UseHttps` as HTTP/3 requires HTTPS.

- **Router, Firewall, and Proxy Considerations:**
  - Because not all routers, firewalls, and proxies properly support HTTP/3, it should be configured together with HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2.

For more information, see [Configure endpoints for the ASP.NET Core Kestrel web server](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/servers/kestrel/endpoints).

#### 3. Alt-Svc

##### Overview:
HTTP/3 is discovered as an upgrade from HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2 via the `alt-svc` header.

- **Discovery Process:**
  - The first request will normally use HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2. The server will then advertise HTTP/3 support via the `alt-svc` header, allowing the client to upgrade to HTTP/3 for subsequent requests.

For more information, see [Alt-Svc](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Alt-Svc).

#### 4. Localhost Testing

##### Considerations for Localhost Testing:
- **Browsers:**
  - Browsers don't allow self-signed certificates on HTTP/3, such as the Kestrel development certificate.
- **HttpClient:**
  - `HttpClient` can be used for localhost/loopback testing in .NET 6 or later. Extra configuration is required when using `HttpClient` to make an HTTP/3 request:
    - Set `HttpRequestMessage.Version` to 3.0, or
    - Set `HttpRequestMessage.VersionPolicy` to `HttpVersionPolicy.RequestVersionOrHigher`.

#### 5. HTTP/3 Benefits

HTTP/3 uses the same semantics as HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2: the same request methods, status codes, and message fields apply to all versions. The differences are in the underlying transport.

##### Benefits of HTTP/3 and QUIC:

- **Faster Response Time:**
  - QUIC and HTTP/3 negotiate the connection in fewer round-trips between the client and the server, allowing the first request to reach the server faster.
- **Improved Experience with Packet Loss:**
  - HTTP/2 multiplexes multiple requests via one TCP connection. Packet loss on the connection affects all requests, a problem known as head-of-line blocking. QUIC and HTTP/3 avoid this issue by using separate connections.
- **Supports Network Transitions:**
  - This feature is useful for mobile devices where it is common to switch between WiFi and cellular networks as a device changes location. Currently, HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 connections are interrupted when this happens, but HTTP/3 connections can seamlessly transition between networks.
