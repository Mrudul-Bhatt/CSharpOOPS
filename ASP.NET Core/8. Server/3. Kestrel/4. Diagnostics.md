### Diagnostics in Kestrel

The article "Diagnostics in Kestrel" provides guidance for gathering diagnostics from Kestrel to help troubleshoot issues. Here are the key points explained:

#### 1. Logging

##### Overview:
Kestrel uses `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging` to emit log information. Logs are categorized to help filter and analyze specific types of events.

##### Key Points:
- **Logging Categories:**
  - Different categories are used to organize log events. Some key categories include:
    - `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel`: General server logs including application errors and connection events.
    - `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.BadRequests`: Logs related to bad requests, such as request processing errors.
    - `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Connections`: Logs related to connection management, such as connection acceptance and termination.
    - `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Http2`: Logs specific to HTTP/2 connections.
    - `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Http3`: Logs specific to HTTP/3 connections.

- **Connection Logging:**
  - Kestrel supports `Debug` level logs for byte-level communication, which can be enabled on a per-endpoint basis. This is useful for detailed troubleshooting of connection issues.

#### 2. Metrics

##### Overview:
Metrics represent data measures over intervals of time, such as requests per second. Kestrel emits metrics using `EventCounter`, which can be observed using tools like `dotnet-counters`.

##### Key Points:
- **Available Metrics:**
  - Some of the key metrics provided by Kestrel include:
    - `connections-per-second`: The number of new incoming connections per update interval.
    - `total-connections`: The total number of connections.
    - `tls-handshakes-per-second`: The number of new TLS handshakes per update interval.
    - `total-tls-handshakes`: The total number of TLS handshakes.
    - `current-tls-handshakes`: The number of TLS handshakes in process.
    - `failed-tls-handshakes`: The total number of failed TLS handshakes.
    - `current-connections`: The total number of connections, including idle connections.
    - `connection-queue-length`: The total number of connections queued to the thread pool.
    - `request-queue-length`: The total number of requests queued to the thread pool.
    - `current-upgraded-requests`: The number of active WebSocket requests.

- **Note on Metrics:**
  - The `connections-per-second` and `tls-handshakes-per-second` counters are named incorrectly. They display the number of new connections or TLS handshakes in the last update interval, not per second. Consumers should scale the metric value based on the `DisplayRateTimeScale` of one second.

#### 3. DiagnosticSource

##### Overview:
`DiagnosticSource` is a mechanism for production-time logging with rich data payloads for consumption within the process. It allows capturing detailed diagnostic information.

##### Key Points:
- **Bad Request Events:**
  - Kestrel emits `DiagnosticSource` events for HTTP requests rejected at the server layer, such as malformed requests and protocol violations. These are emitted with the event name `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.BadRequest`.

- **Implementing an Observer:**
  - An observer for `DiagnosticListener` must be created to capture these events. The observer can then retrieve the underlying exception from the `IFeatureCollection` payload.

```csharp name=BadRequestEventListener.cs
class BadRequestEventListener : IObserver<KeyValuePair<string, object>>, IDisposable
{
    private readonly IDisposable _subscription;
    private readonly Action<IBadRequestExceptionFeature> _callback;

    public BadRequestEventListener(DiagnosticListener diagnosticListener, Action<IBadRequestExceptionFeature> callback)
    {
        _subscription = diagnosticListener.Subscribe(this!, IsEnabled);
        _callback = callback;
    }
    private static readonly Predicate<string> IsEnabled = (provider) => provider switch
    {
        "Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.BadRequest" => true,
        _ => false
    };
    public void OnNext(KeyValuePair<string, object> pair)
    {
        if (pair.Value is IFeatureCollection featureCollection)
        {
            var badRequestFeature = featureCollection.Get<IBadRequestExceptionFeature>();

            if (badRequestFeature is not null)
            {
                _callback(badRequestFeature);
            }
        }
    }
    public void OnError(Exception error) { }
    public void OnCompleted() { }
    public virtual void Dispose() => _subscription.Dispose();
}
```

- **Subscribing to Events:**
  - Subscribe to the ASP.NET Core `DiagnosticListener` with the observer. For example, create a callback that logs the underlying exception.

```csharp name=Program.cs
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
var app = builder.Build();
var diagnosticSource = app.Services.GetRequiredService<DiagnosticListener>();
using var badRequestListener = new BadRequestEventListener(diagnosticSource, (badRequestExceptionFeature) =>
{
    app.Logger.LogError(badRequestExceptionFeature.Error, "Bad request received");
});
app.MapGet("/", () => "Hello world");
app.Run();
```

#### 4. Behavior with Debugger Attached

##### Overview:
Certain timeouts and rate limits aren't enforced when a debugger is attached to a Kestrel process to facilitate debugging.

##### Key Points:
- **Non-enforced Limits:**
  - `KeepAliveTimeout`
  - `RequestHeadersTimeout`
  - `MinRequestBodyDataRate`
  - `MinResponseDataRate`
  - `IConnectionTimeoutFeature`
