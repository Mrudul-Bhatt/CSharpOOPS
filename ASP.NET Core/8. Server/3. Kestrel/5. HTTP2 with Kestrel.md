### Use HTTP/2 with the ASP.NET Core Kestrel Web Server

The article "Use HTTP/2 with the ASP.NET Core Kestrel web server" provides detailed information on using HTTP/2 with Kestrel. Here are the key points explained:

#### 1. Overview

##### Requirements:
HTTP/2 is available for ASP.NET Core apps if the following base requirements are met:

- **Operating System:**
  - Windows Server 2016/Windows 10 or later.
  - Linux with OpenSSL 1.0.2 or later (e.g., Ubuntu 16.04 or later).
  - macOS 10.15 or later.
  - Note: Kestrel has limited support for HTTP/2 on Windows Server 2012 R2 and Windows 8.1 due to the limited list of supported TLS cipher suites.

- **Target Framework:**
  - .NET Core 2.2 or later.

- **Connection Requirements:**
  - Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) connection.
  - TLS 1.2 or later connection.

- **Protocol Reporting:**
  - If an HTTP/2 connection is established, `HttpRequest.Protocol` reports `HTTP/2`.

- **Default Enablement:**
  - Starting with .NET Core 3.0, HTTP/2 is enabled by default.

For more information on configuration, see the [Kestrel HTTP/2 limits](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/servers/kestrel/options#http2-limits) and [ListenOptions.Protocols](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.server.kestrel.core.listenoptions.protocols).

#### 2. Advanced HTTP/2 Features

##### Overview:
Kestrel supports advanced HTTP/2 features that are particularly useful for gRPC, including response trailers and sending reset frames.

##### Trailers:
Trailers are HTTP headers sent after the body of an HTTP message. They are useful for sending metadata at the end of the response.

- **Trailers Support:**
  - Kestrel supports sending trailers, which can be configured using the `Trailer` property on the `HttpResponse`.

- **Documentation Reference:**
  - For more information, see the [Trailers documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/servers/kestrel/trailers).

##### Reset Frames:
Reset frames in HTTP/2 are used to abruptly terminate a stream. This can be useful for signaling errors or interrupting long-running operations.

- **Reset Support:**
  - Kestrel supports sending reset frames using the `Reset` method.

- **Documentation Reference:**
  - For more information, see the [Reset documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/servers/kestrel/reset).

#### 3. Configuration

##### Enabling HTTP/2:
HTTP/2 can be configured in the `Program.cs` file by setting the `Protocols` property on `ListenOptions`.

```csharp name=Program.cs
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.WebHost.ConfigureKestrel(serverOptions =>
{
    serverOptions.Listen(IPAddress.Any, 5001, listenOptions =>
    {
        listenOptions.Protocols = HttpProtocols.Http2;
        listenOptions.UseHttps();
    });
});
var app = builder.Build();
app.Run();
```

##### Configuration Options:
- **HTTP/2 Limits:**
  - Various limits for HTTP/2 can be configured, such as maximum frame size, maximum streams per connection, etc.

- **ListenOptions.Protocols:**
  - This property allows specifying the supported protocols (HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, etc.) for an endpoint.
