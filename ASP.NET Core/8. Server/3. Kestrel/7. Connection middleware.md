### Use Connection Middleware with the ASP.NET Core Kestrel Web Server

The article "Use connection middleware with the ASP.NET Core Kestrel web server" provides detailed information on using connection middleware in Kestrel. Here are the key points explained:

#### 1. Connection Logging

##### Overview:
Connection logging is connection middleware included with ASP.NET Core. It emits Debug-level logs for byte-level communication, which is useful for troubleshooting problems in low-level communication, such as during TLS encryption and behind proxies.

##### Key Points:
- **Usage:**
  - Call `UseConnectionLogging` to enable connection logging.
  - Connection logging can be placed before `UseHttps` to log encrypted traffic or after to log decrypted traffic.
  
- **Code Example:**

```csharp name=Program.cs
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.WebHost.ConfigureKestrel(serverOptions =>
{
    serverOptions.Listen(IPAddress.Any, 5000, listenOptions =>
    {
        listenOptions.UseConnectionLogging();
        listenOptions.UseHttps();
    });
});
var app = builder.Build();
app.Run();
```

#### 2. Create Custom Connection Middleware

##### Overview:
Custom connection middleware can be created to handle specific tasks on a per-connection basis. For example, it can filter TLS handshakes for specific ciphers.

##### Key Points:
- **Example Middleware:**
  - The following example shows custom middleware that throws a `NotSupportedException` if the connection uses a `CipherAlgorithmType.Null` cipher algorithm, indicating no encryption.

```csharp name=Program.cs
using System.Net;
using System.Security.Authentication;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Connections;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.WebHost.ConfigureKestrel(serverOptions =>
{
    serverOptions.Listen(IPAddress.Any, 5000, listenOptions =>
    {
        listenOptions.Use((context, next) =>
        {
            if (context.Features.Get<SslStream>().CipherAlgorithm == CipherAlgorithmType.Null)
            {
                throw new NotSupportedException("Unencrypted connections are not supported.");
            }
            return next();
        });
        listenOptions.UseHttps();
    });
});
var app = builder.Build();
app.Run();
```

### Summary

Connection middleware in Kestrel allows you to intercept and handle connections at a low level, providing flexibility for tasks such as logging and custom connection handling. Connection logging is a built-in middleware that helps troubleshoot low-level communication issues, while custom middleware can be created for specific needs, such as filtering TLS handshakes.
