### Kestrel Web Server in ASP.NET Core

The article "Kestrel web server in ASP.NET Core" provides detailed information on using Kestrel, the cross-platform web server for ASP.NET Core. Here are the first four key points explained:

#### 1. Get Started

##### Overview:
ASP.NET Core project templates use Kestrel by default when not hosted with IIS. Kestrel is configured by default in the generated `Program.cs` file.

##### Key Points:
- **Default Configuration:**
  - The default ASP.NET Core project templates set up Kestrel as the web server if the application is not hosted with IIS.

- **Example Configuration:**
  - The following code snippet from a template-generated `Program.cs` file shows how Kestrel is configured using `WebApplication.CreateBuilder`.

````csharp name=Program.cs
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
var app = builder.Build();

app.MapGet("/", () => "Hello World!");

app.Run();
````

- **Further Configuration:**
  - For more information on configuring `WebApplication` and `WebApplicationBuilder`, see the documentation on [Minimal APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/minimal-apis).

#### 2. Optional Client Certificates

##### Overview:
ASP.NET Core applications can protect a subset of the app with a certificate.

##### Key Points:
- **Client Certificates:**
  - Optional client certificates can be used to protect specific parts of the application.

- **Documentation Reference:**
  - For detailed information on configuring optional client certificates, see the documentation on [Optional Client Certificates](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/certauth#optional-client-certificates).

#### 3. Behavior with Debugger Attached

##### Overview:
When a debugger is attached to a Kestrel process, certain timeouts and rate limits are not enforced to facilitate debugging.

##### Key Points:
- **Timeouts and Rate Limits:**
  - The following timeouts and rate limits are not enforced when a debugger is attached:
    - `KeepAliveTimeout`
    - `RequestHeadersTimeout`
    - `MinRequestBodyDataRate`
    - `MinResponseDataRate`
    - `IConnectionTimeoutFeature`
    - `IHttpMinRequestBodyDataRateFeature`
    - `IHttpMinResponseDataRateFeature`

- **Purpose:**
  - This behavior allows developers to debug their applications without being interrupted by these constraints.

#### 4. Additional Resources

##### Overview:
Additional resources are provided for further reading and configuration guidance for Kestrel.

##### Key Points:
- **Endpoint Configuration:**
  - Detailed information on configuring endpoints for Kestrel can be found in the documentation on [Kestrel Endpoints](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/servers/kestrel/endpoints).

- **Kestrel Options:**
  - For more information on Kestrel options, see the documentation on [Kestrel Options](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/servers/kestrel/options).

- **HTTP/2 Support:**
  - Information on HTTP/2 support in Kestrel is available in the documentation on [HTTP/2 Support](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/servers/kestrel/http2).

- **Reverse Proxy:**
  - Guidance on when to use Kestrel with a reverse proxy can be found in the documentation on [When to Use a Reverse Proxy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/servers/kestrel/when-to-use-a-reverse-proxy).

These key points provide an overview of the initial topics in the Kestrel web server implementation in ASP.NET Core, highlighting how to get started, the use of optional client certificates, behavior with a debugger attached, and additional resources for further configuration. For more detailed information, you can refer to the official article on Microsoft Docs: [Kestrel web server in ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/servers/kestrel).
