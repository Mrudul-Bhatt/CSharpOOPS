### Explanation of "Troubleshoot ASP.NET Core on Azure App Service and IIS" in Microsoft Docs for ASP.NET Core

#### 1. App Startup Errors
- **Common Causes**:
  - **Configuration Issues**: Misconfigured settings in the `appsettings.json` or `web.config` files.
  - **Missing Dependencies**: Missing runtime or NuGet package dependencies.
  - **Code Errors**: Exceptions in the application code that prevent startup.
- **Troubleshooting Steps**:
  1. **Check Logs**: Review application logs for error messages.
  2. **Enable stdout Log**: Enable stdout logging in the `web.config` file by setting `stdoutLogEnabled="true"` and specifying a log file path.
  3. **Event Viewer**: Check the Windows Event Viewer for application error logs.
  4. **Remote Debugging**: Attach a debugger to the application process to inspect and diagnose issues.

#### 2. Troubleshoot on Azure App Service
- **Common Issues**:
  - **Deployment Issues**: Problems with deploying the application to Azure App Service.
  - **Configuration Issues**: Incorrect app settings or connection strings.
  - **Scaling Issues**: Problems related to scaling the application.
- **Troubleshooting Steps**:
  1. **Access Kudu Console**: Use the Kudu console available at `https://<app-name>.scm.azurewebsites.net` to access the application's file system and logs.
  2. **Check Application Logs**: Review log files in the `LogFiles` directory using Kudu.
  3. **Review Deployment Logs**: Check deployment logs for errors or warnings.
  4. **App Service Diagnostics**: Use the App Service diagnostics tool to identify and resolve common issues.
  5. **Remote Debugging**: Enable remote debugging in the Azure portal and attach a debugger from Visual Studio.

#### 3. Troubleshoot on IIS
- **Common Issues**:
  - **Configuration Issues**: Incorrect IIS settings or application pool configurations.
  - **Permission Issues**: Insufficient permissions for the application to access resources.
  - **Module Issues**: Problems with IIS modules such as ASP.NET Core Module.
- **Troubleshooting Steps**:
  1. **Check IIS Logs**: Review IIS logs located in the `%SystemDrive%\inetpub\logs\LogFiles` directory.
  2. **Review Event Viewer Logs**: Check the Windows Event Viewer for IIS-related error logs.
  3. **Check Application Pool**: Ensure the application pool is running and configured correctly.
  4. **Verify Permissions**: Ensure the application pool identity has the necessary permissions to access resources.
  5. **Enable Failed Request Tracing**: Enable and configure failed request tracing to capture detailed error information.

#### 4. Clear Package Caches
- **Purpose**: Clearing package caches can resolve issues related to corrupted or outdated packages.
- **Steps**:
  1. **Clear NuGet Cache**: Use the `dotnet nuget locals all --clear` command to clear the NuGet package cache.
  2. **Clear npm Cache**: If using Node.js, use the `npm cache clean --force` command to clear the npm cache.
  3. **Clear Bower Cache**: If using Bower, use the `bower cache clean` command to clear the Bower cache.

### Summary
- **App Startup Errors**: Check logs, enable stdout logging, review Event Viewer, and use remote debugging.
- **Troubleshoot on Azure App Service**: Use Kudu console, check application and deployment logs, use App Service diagnostics, and enable remote debugging.
- **Troubleshoot on IIS**: Review IIS and Event Viewer logs, check application pool settings, verify permissions, and enable failed request tracing.
- **Clear Package Caches**: Clear NuGet, npm, and Bower caches to resolve issues related to corrupted or outdated packages.
