It seems that I'm unable to directly access the content of the article "Host ASP.NET Core on Windows with IIS" from the Microsoft Docs for ASP.NET Core repository. However, I can provide a general explanation of the first four points based on common knowledge and documentation practices for ASP.NET Core hosting on Windows with IIS.

### 1. Supported platforms
- **Windows Server Versions:** ASP.NET Core applications can be hosted on Windows Server versions such as Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2019, and later versions.
- **Windows Versions:** Hosting is also supported on Windows desktop operating systems like Windows 10 and Windows 11, primarily for development and testing purposes.
- **IIS Versions:** Internet Information Services (IIS) 10.0 or later is required to host ASP.NET Core applications.

### 2. Install the ASP.NET Core Module/Hosting Bundle
- **ASP.NET Core Module (ANCM):** This module allows ASP.NET Core applications to work with IIS. It is responsible for process management and forwarding requests to the Kestrel server.
- **Hosting Bundle:** The hosting bundle includes the .NET Runtime, .NET SDK, and the ASP.NET Core Module. It can be installed via a downloadable installer from the .NET website.
- **Installation Steps:** Typically, you download the installer, run it, and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

### 3. Get started
- **Create a New ASP.NET Core Application:** You can use the .NET CLI or Visual Studio to create a new ASP.NET Core web application.
  - Example using .NET CLI: `dotnet new mvc -o MyApp`
- **Develop Your Application:** Implement the necessary features and functionality in your ASP.NET Core application using your preferred development environment.
- **Publish Your Application:** Use the `dotnet publish` command to compile your application and prepare it for deployment.
  - Example: `dotnet publish -c Release -o ./publish`

### 4. Configuration
- **Web.config File:** The `web.config` file is used to configure IIS settings for your ASP.NET Core application. It includes settings for the ASP.NET Core Module, such as process path and arguments.
- **Environment Variables:** Configure environment variables within the `web.config` file or via the IIS management console to control application settings.
- **ApplicationHost.config:** For advanced configuration, you might need to modify the `applicationHost.config` file, which contains global IIS settings.

For detailed and specific instructions, I would recommend referring to the official Microsoft documentation for "Host ASP.NET Core on Windows with IIS."
