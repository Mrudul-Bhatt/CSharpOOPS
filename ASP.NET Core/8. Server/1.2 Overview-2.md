### Web Server Implementations in ASP.NET Core

Here are the remaining key points explained from the article "Web server implementations in ASP.NET Core":

#### 5. ASP.NET Core Server Infrastructure

##### Overview:
ASP.NET Core provides a flexible server infrastructure that allows for customization and extension. The server infrastructure is exposed through the `IApplicationBuilder` interface available in the `Startup.Configure` method.

##### Key Points:
- **Server Features:**
  - The `IApplicationBuilder.ServerFeatures` property exposes the server features available to the application.
  
- **IServerAddressesFeature:**
  - The `IServerAddressesFeature` interface can be used to find out which port the server implementation has bound at runtime.

```csharp name=Startup.cs
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env)
{
    var serverAddressesFeature = app.ServerFeatures.Get<IServerAddressesFeature>();
    if (serverAddressesFeature != null)
    {
        foreach (var address in serverAddressesFeature.Addresses)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Listening on: {address}");
        }
    }
    
    app.UseMvc();
}
```

#### 6. Custom Servers

##### Overview:
If the built-in servers do not meet the application's requirements, a custom server implementation can be created. This allows for greater flexibility and customization.

##### Key Points:
- **Custom Implementation:**
  - Developers can create their own custom server implementation if the built-in servers (Kestrel, HTTP.sys) do not meet their needs.
  
- **OWIN:**
  - The [Open Web Interface for .NET (OWIN) guide](xref:fundamentals/owin) demonstrates how to create a custom server implementation.

```csharp name=CustomServer.cs
public class CustomServer : IServer
{
    // Implement necessary methods and properties
}
```

#### 7. Server Startup

##### Overview:
The server is launched when the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or editor starts the application. Various tools and configurations can be used to start the app and server.

##### Key Points:
- **IDE Launch:**
  - Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, and Visual Studio for Mac can be used to start the app and server with launch profiles or built-in debuggers.

- **dotnet run:**
  - When launching the app from a command prompt in the project's folder, `dotnet run` launches the app and server (Kestrel and HTTP.sys only).

- **launchSettings.json:**
  - A `launchSettings.json` file provides configuration when launching an app with `dotnet run` or with a debugger built into tooling, such as Visual Studio.

```json name=launchSettings.json
{
  "profiles": {
    "IIS Express": {
      "commandName": "IISExpress",
      "launchBrowser": true,
      "environmentVariables": {
        "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development"
      }
    },
    "MyApp": {
      "commandName": "Project",
      "dotnetRunMessages": true,
      "launchBrowser": true,
      "applicationUrl": "http://localhost:5000",
      "environmentVariables": {
        "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### 8. HTTP/2 Support

##### Overview:
HTTP/2 is supported with ASP.NET Core in various deployment scenarios. HTTP/2 provides performance improvements over HTTP/1.1, such as multiplexing and header compression.

##### Key Points:
- **Deployment Scenarios:**
  - HTTP/2 is supported with Kestrel, HTTP.sys, and IIS (in-process and out-of-process).

- **Operating System and Framework Requirements:**
  - Kestrel: Requires Windows Server 2016/Windows 10 or later, Linux with OpenSSL 1.0.2 or later, or macOS 10.15 or later. Target framework: .NET Core 2.2 or later.
  - HTTP.sys: Requires Windows Server 2016/Windows 10 or later.
  - IIS (in-process and out-of-process): Requires Windows Server 2016/Windows 10 or later; IIS 10 or later.

- **ALPN and TLS:**
  - An HTTP/2 connection must use Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) and TLS 1.2 or later.

For more information, see the documentation on [HTTP/2 support](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/servers/kestrel/http2) and [HTTP/2 support in HTTP.sys](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/servers/httpsys#http2-support).

#### 9. Enterprise Web App Patterns

##### Overview:
Enterprise web applications often require specific patterns and practices to ensure they are scalable, maintainable, and performant. Using established patterns can help achieve these goals.

##### Key Points:
- **Layered Architecture:**
  - Use a layered architecture to separate concerns and improve maintainability. Common layers include presentation, business logic, and data access.

- **Dependency Injection:**
  - Use dependency injection to manage dependencies and promote loose coupling between components.

- **Repository Pattern:**
  - Implement the repository pattern to abstract data access logic and promote testability.

- **Unit of Work Pattern:**
  - Use the unit of work pattern to manage transactions and ensure data consistency.

- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation):**
  - Separate read and write operations into different models to optimize performance and scalability.

- **Event Sourcing:**
  - Use event sourcing to capture all changes to application state as a sequence of events, providing a reliable audit trail and enabling complex state reconstruction.

- **Microservices:**
  - Consider using a microservices architecture for large, complex applications to enhance scalability and maintainability.

These best practices and patterns help in designing high-performance and scalable ASP.NET Core applications.
