### HTTP.sys Web Server Implementation in ASP.NET Core

Here are the remaining key points explained from the article "HTTP.sys web server implementation in ASP.NET Core":

#### 5. Proxy Server and Load Balancer Scenarios

##### Overview:
When hosting ASP.NET Core applications with HTTP.sys behind proxy servers and load balancers, additional configuration might be required to handle requests correctly.

##### Key Points:
- **Forwarded Headers:**
  - Configure forwarded headers to preserve the original client IP address and protocol information when requests pass through a proxy or load balancer.

- **Forwarded Headers Middleware:**
  - Use the `ForwardedHeadersMiddleware` to process headers forwarded by proxy servers and load balancers, such as X-Forwarded-For and X-Forwarded-Proto.

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.Configure<ForwardedHeadersOptions>(options =>
    {
        options.ForwardedHeaders = ForwardedHeaders.XForwardedFor | ForwardedHeaders.XForwardedProto;
        options.KnownNetworks.Clear();
        options.KnownProxies.Clear();
    });
}

public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env)
{
    app.UseForwardedHeaders();
    app.UseMvc();
}
```

- **Considerations:**
  - Ensure the proxy or load balancer is configured to forward the appropriate headers.
  - Be cautious with top-level wildcard bindings to avoid security vulnerabilities.

#### 6. Get Detailed Timing Information with IHttpSysRequestTimingFeature

##### Overview:
`IHttpSysRequestTimingFeature` provides detailed timing information for requests handled by HTTP.sys, which can be useful for performance monitoring and troubleshooting.

##### Key Points:
- **Timing Information:**
  - Timestamps are obtained using the `QueryPerformanceCounter` API, which provides high-resolution timing data.

- **Usage:**
  - Use the `TryGetTimestamp` method to retrieve the timestamp for a specific timing type.
  - Use the `TryGetElapsedTime` method to calculate the elapsed time between two specified timing types.

```csharp
app.Use(async (context, next) =>
{
    var timingFeature = context.Features.Get<IHttpSysRequestTimingFeature>();
    if (timingFeature != null)
    {
        long startTimestamp;
        if (timingFeature.TryGetTimestamp(HttpSysRequestTimingType.RequestStart, out startTimestamp))
        {
            // Do something with the start timestamp
        }
    }
    await next();
});
```

- **Requirements:**
  - Requires Windows 10 version 2004, Windows Server 2022, or later.

#### 7. Advanced HTTP/2 Features to Support gRPC

##### Overview:
HTTP.sys supports advanced HTTP/2 features that are necessary for running gRPC services, including response trailers and sending reset frames.

##### Key Points:
- **Trailers:**
  - HTTP.sys supports trailers, allowing additional metadata to be sent at the end of an HTTP/2 response.

```csharp
app.Use(async (context, next) =>
{
    context.Response.AppendTrailer("Grpc-Status", "0");
    await next();
});
```

- **Reset Frames:**
  - HTTP.sys supports sending reset frames to terminate HTTP/2 streams, which is useful for signaling errors or interruptions.

- **Requirements:**
  - Requires Windows 11 Build 22000 or later, Windows Server 2022 Build 20348 or later.
  - TLS 1.2 or later connection.

#### 8. Tracing

##### Overview:
HTTP.sys provides tracing capabilities to help diagnose and troubleshoot issues by capturing detailed information about HTTP requests and responses.

##### Key Points:
- **Trace Collection:**
  - Tracing can be enabled to collect detailed information about the HTTP.sys request processing pipeline.

- **Use Cases:**
  - Useful for diagnosing performance issues, troubleshooting errors, and understanding request flows.

- **Documentation:**
  - Refer to the [HTTP.sys Manageability Scenarios](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/http/http-sys-manageability-scenarios) documentation for detailed information on enabling and using tracing.

These key points provide an overview of the remaining topics in the HTTP.sys web server implementation in ASP.NET Core, highlighting proxy server and load balancer scenarios, detailed timing information, advanced HTTP/2 features for gRPC support, and tracing capabilities.
