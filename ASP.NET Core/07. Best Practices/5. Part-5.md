### ASP.NET Core Best Practices

Continuing from the previous points, here are the next three key points explained:

#### 13. Minimize Exceptions

##### Overview:
Exceptions should be rare in an application. Throwing and catching exceptions is slow relative to other code flow patterns, so they shouldn't be used to control normal program flow.

##### Key Points:
- **Avoid Using Exceptions for Control Flow:**
  - **Do not** use exceptions to manage normal program logic. Instead, use conditional checks to handle expected conditions.
  
- **Handle Exceptions Appropriately:**
  - **Do** use exceptions for handling unexpected or abnormal conditions that your application cannot recover from.

- **Performance Impact:**
  - Exceptions are expensive in terms of performance. Frequently throwing and catching exceptions can degrade application performance, especially in hot code paths.

- **Detection and Diagnostics:**
  - Use application diagnostic tools such as Application Insights to identify and diagnose common exceptions that may affect performance.

```csharp name=ExceptionHandling.cs
public class MyService
{
    public void ProcessData(string input)
    {
        if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(input))
        {
            // Avoid throwing exceptions for control flow
            // Handle the condition with a conditional check
            return;
        }

        try
        {
            // Process the input data
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            // Log and handle unexpected exceptions
            // Do not use exceptions to control normal flow
            Console.WriteLine($"An error occurred: {ex.Message}");
        }
    }
}
```

#### 14. Avoid Synchronous Read or Write on HttpRequest/HttpResponse Body

##### Overview:
All I/O operations in ASP.NET Core are asynchronous. Using synchronous read or write operations on the `HttpRequest` or `HttpResponse` body can lead to performance issues and thread pool starvation.

##### Key Points:
- **Avoid Sync-over-Async:**
  - **Do not** use synchronous methods like `StreamReader.ReadToEnd()` or `StreamWriter.Write()`. These methods block the current thread and can cause thread pool starvation.

- **Use Asynchronous Methods:**
  - **Do** use asynchronous methods like `StreamReader.ReadToEndAsync()` or `StreamWriter.WriteAsync()` to read or write data.

- **Example:**
  - The following example demonstrates the correct use of asynchronous methods for reading the request body.

````csharp name=AsyncReadWrite.cs
public class MyController : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpPost]
    public async Task<IActionResult> ReadRequestBody()
    {
        using (var reader = new StreamReader(Request.Body))
        {
            var content = await reader.ReadToEndAsync();
            // Process the content
        }
        return Ok();
    }

    [HttpPost]
    public async Task<IActionResult> WriteResponseBody()
    {
        using (var writer = new StreamWriter(Response.Body))
        {
            await writer.WriteAsync("Hello, world!");
        }
        return Ok();
    }
}
````

#### 15. Prefer ReadFormAsync over Request.Form

##### Overview:
Reading form data asynchronously helps to avoid blocking the thread and improves the scalability and performance of the application.

##### Key Points:
- **Avoid Sync-over-Async:**
  - **Do not** use `HttpContext.Request.Form` directly as it performs a synchronous read which can block the thread.

- **Use ReadFormAsync:**
  - **Do** use `HttpContext.Request.ReadFormAsync()` to read form data asynchronously.

- **Example:**
  - The following example demonstrates the correct use of `ReadFormAsync` to read form data asynchronously.

````csharp name=FormReading.cs
public class MyController : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpPost]
    public async Task<IActionResult> HandleFormSubmission()
    {
        var form = await HttpContext.Request.ReadFormAsync();
        var formField = form["formField"];
        // Process the form data
        return Ok();
    }
}
````

These best practices help in designing high-performance and scalable ASP.NET Core applications by minimizing exceptions, using asynchronous read and write operations, and preferring asynchronous form data reading.
