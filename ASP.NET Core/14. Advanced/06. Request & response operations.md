Here‚Äôs a clear **point-by-point summary** of the Microsoft Docs article **‚ÄúRequest and response operations in ASP.NET Core‚Äù**:

---

### ‚úÖ 1. **Accessing HttpRequest and HttpResponse**

* ASP.NET Core gives you access to the current HTTP request and response through:

  ```csharp
  HttpContext.Request
  HttpContext.Response
  ```

* Example in middleware or controller:

  ```csharp
  var request = context.Request;
  var response = context.Response;
  ```

---

### ‚úÖ 2. **Working with Request Properties**

* Common properties:

  * `Request.Method` ‚Üí HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.)
  * `Request.Path` ‚Üí requested URL path
  * `Request.Query` ‚Üí query string collection
  * `Request.Headers` ‚Üí request headers
  * `Request.Body` ‚Üí request body stream

* Example:

  ```csharp
  var userAgent = request.Headers["User-Agent"];
  ```

---

### ‚úÖ 3. **Reading the Request Body**

* The request body is a stream; you can read it like:

  ```csharp
  using var reader = new StreamReader(request.Body);
  var bodyText = await reader.ReadToEndAsync();
  ```

* Important:

  * **Enable buffering** if you need to read the body multiple times:

    ```csharp
    request.EnableBuffering();
    ```

---

### ‚úÖ 4. **Modifying the Response**

* You can set:

  * `Response.StatusCode` ‚Üí HTTP status code
  * `Response.Headers` ‚Üí response headers
  * `Response.ContentType` ‚Üí e.g., `application/json`

* Example:

  ```csharp
  response.StatusCode = 200;
  response.ContentType = "text/plain";
  await response.WriteAsync("Hello, World!");
  ```

---

### ‚úÖ 5. **Working with Headers**

* Read request headers:

  ```csharp
  var accept = request.Headers["Accept"];
  ```

* Set response headers:

  ```csharp
  response.Headers["Cache-Control"] = "no-cache";
  ```

---

### ‚úÖ 6. **Working with Query String and Form Data**

* Query string:

  ```csharp
  var id = request.Query["id"];
  ```

* Form data (requires `[FromForm]` or `request.Form` in middleware):

  ```csharp
  var formValue = request.Form["fieldName"];
  ```

---

### ‚úÖ 7. **Streaming Responses**

* Write large responses efficiently:

  ```csharp
  await response.Body.WriteAsync(buffer, 0, buffer.Length);
  ```

* Use `FileStreamResult` in MVC for file downloads.

---

### ‚úÖ 8. **Reading Request Cancellation**

* Detect when the client disconnects:

  ```csharp
  HttpContext.RequestAborted
  ```

* Example:

  ```csharp
  cancellationToken.ThrowIfCancellationRequested();
  ```

---

### ‚úÖ 9. **Handling Content Length**

* Request content length:

  ```csharp
  var length = request.ContentLength;
  ```

* Set response content length:

  ```csharp
  response.ContentLength = someValue;
  ```

---

### ‚úÖ 10. **Summary**

* `HttpRequest` and `HttpResponse` provide full access to the HTTP pipeline.
* Use streams carefully to avoid locking threads.
* Always check for cancellation and buffering when reading/writing bodies.
* Keep response headers and status codes correct for client behavior.
