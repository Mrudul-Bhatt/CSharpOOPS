I currently don't have access to the specific article "Detect changes with change tokens in ASP.NET Core" from the Microsoft Docs, but I can still provide a **point-by-point explanation** based on my knowledge of change tokens in ASP.NET Core.

---

### ✅ 1. **What are Change Tokens?**

* Change tokens are a mechanism in ASP.NET Core to **track changes in resources** and **notify applications** when the resource has changed.
* Commonly used for scenarios like **file changes**, **configuration updates**, or **cache invalidation**.

---

### ✅ 2. **How Change Tokens Work**

* **IChangeToken** is the interface that tracks changes.

  * It can be **observed** by code to determine if a resource has changed.
  * It provides methods like `HasChanged` (to check if a change has occurred) and `RegisterChangeCallback` (to register a callback to handle the change).

---

### ✅ 3. **Common Use Cases for Change Tokens**

* **File system monitoring**: Trigger actions when a file is updated or modified.
* **Configuration changes**: React to configuration file changes (e.g., appsettings.json).
* **Cache invalidation**: Invalidate cached data when a relevant resource is modified.

---

### ✅ 4. **Creating a Change Token**

```csharp
var changeToken = new CancellationChangeToken(new CancellationTokenSource().Token);
```

* This creates a token that can be monitored for changes (in this example, using a `CancellationToken`).

---

### ✅ 5. **Using Change Tokens in File Providers**

* File providers expose change tokens to track changes in files or directories.

  ```csharp
  var fileProvider = new PhysicalFileProvider("/path/to/directory");
  var changeToken = fileProvider.Watch("myfile.txt");
  ```
* Use `Watch` method to monitor file changes, which will return a change token.

---

### ✅ 6. **Registering Callbacks on Change Tokens**

* Register a callback to execute when the resource changes:

  ```csharp
  changeToken.RegisterChangeCallback(state =>
  {
      Console.WriteLine("The resource has changed!");
  }, null);
  ```

---

### ✅ 7. **Polling for Changes**

* You can periodically check if a change has occurred:

  ```csharp
  if (changeToken.HasChanged)
  {
      // Resource has changed, perform an action
  }
  ```

---

### ✅ 8. **Use in Configuration Providers**

* You can use change tokens to monitor changes in configuration files:

  ```csharp
  IConfiguration configuration = builder.Build();
  var changeToken = configuration.GetReloadToken();
  changeToken.RegisterChangeCallback(state =>
  {
      Console.WriteLine("Configuration has changed!");
  }, null);
  ```

---

### ✅ 9. **Efficient Resource Monitoring**

* Change tokens are lightweight and help **reduce polling overhead** by notifying the application only when an actual change occurs, making them **efficient** for performance-sensitive scenarios.

---

### ✅ 10. **Integration with Caching**

* Used for cache invalidation:

  * When underlying data or resources change, cache data can be invalidated and reloaded based on the change token.

  ```csharp
  var token = changeToken;
  cache.Set(key, value, new MemoryCacheEntryOptions { ChangeTokens = { token } });
  ```

---

### ✅ 11. **Summary**

* **Change tokens** allow you to efficiently **track changes** to resources and take action when those resources are modified.
* Used widely in scenarios like file monitoring, configuration reloading, and cache management.
* **Efficient and lightweight** compared to constant polling.

---

If you'd like, I can also:
✅ Provide a **complete code sample** implementing change tokens with file or config change detection.
✅ Set up a **real-world use case** showing how you might use them for cache invalidation.

Would you like one of these examples?
