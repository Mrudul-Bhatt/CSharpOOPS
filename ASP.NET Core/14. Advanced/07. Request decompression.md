Here’s a clear **point-by-point summary** of the Microsoft Docs article **“Request decompression in ASP.NET Core”**:

---

### ✅ 1. **What is Request Decompression?**

* Request decompression is the **automatic decompression of incoming HTTP request bodies** that are compressed (e.g., with `gzip` or `brotli`) by the client.
* Useful when clients send large payloads (like JSON) in compressed form to improve performance and reduce network bandwidth.

---

### ✅ 2. **Why Use Request Decompression Middleware?**

* Without decompression, your app receives compressed request bodies that you would need to manually decompress.
* The **Request Decompression Middleware** in ASP.NET Core:

  * Automatically decompresses the request body.
  * Works transparently before model binding or reading from `HttpRequest.Body`.

---

### ✅ 3. **How to Enable Request Decompression**

* Install the required NuGet package:

  ```
  dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.RequestDecompression
  ```

---

### ✅ 4. **Configure Middleware in Program.cs**

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Services.AddRequestDecompression();

var app = builder.Build();

app.UseRequestDecompression();

app.MapPost("/", async context =>
{
    using var reader = new StreamReader(context.Request.Body);
    var body = await reader.ReadToEndAsync();
    await context.Response.WriteAsync($"Received {body.Length} characters.");
});

app.Run();
```

---

### ✅ 5. **Supported Encodings**

* The middleware supports:

  * `gzip`
  * `brotli`
* You can **configure supported encodings**:

  ```csharp
  builder.Services.AddRequestDecompression(options =>
  {
      options.Providers.Add<BrotliDecompressionProvider>();
      options.Providers.Add<GzipDecompressionProvider>();
  });
  ```

---

### ✅ 6. **Client Requirements**

* The client must:

  * Set the `Content-Encoding` header to indicate the compression type (`gzip` or `br`).
  * Send a compressed request body.

---

### ✅ 7. **Configure Maximum Request Body Size**

* By default, the max request body size applies **after decompression**.
* To handle large decompressed payloads, adjust:

  ```csharp
  builder.WebHost.ConfigureKestrel(options =>
  {
      options.Limits.MaxRequestBodySize = 104857600; // 100 MB
  });
  ```

---

### ✅ 8. **Common Use Cases**

* APIs receiving:

  * Large JSON payloads.
  * File uploads.
  * Bulk data from clients or IoT devices.

---

### ✅ 9. **Order in Middleware Pipeline**

* Make sure `app.UseRequestDecompression()` is placed **early in the middleware pipeline**, ideally before:

  * Routing
  * Authorization
  * Model binding

---

### ✅ 10. **Custom Decompression Providers**

* You can implement a **custom decompression provider** by:

  * Creating a class implementing `IRequestDecompressionProvider`.
  * Adding it to `options.Providers`.

---

### ✅ 11. **Summary**

* The Request Decompression Middleware makes it easy to handle compressed HTTP request bodies.
* It improves efficiency, reduces manual handling, and integrates smoothly with ASP.NET Core.
* Always test clients to ensure they send proper `Content-Encoding` headers.
