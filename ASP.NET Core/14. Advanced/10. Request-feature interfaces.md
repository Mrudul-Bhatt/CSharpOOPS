Here’s a clear **point-by-point summary** of the Microsoft Docs article **“Request Features in ASP.NET Core”**:

---

### ✅ 1. **What are Request Features?**

* Low-level **abstractions** in ASP.NET Core that represent HTTP request and response data.
* Expose details like:

  * HTTP request method, path, headers, body.
  * HTTP response status, headers, body.
* Allow advanced middleware or server components to **extend or customize** behavior.

---

### ✅ 2. **Main Interfaces**

* `IHttpRequestFeature` → exposes request details (method, scheme, path, query, body).
* `IHttpResponseFeature` → exposes response details (status code, headers, body).
* `IHttpConnectionFeature` → provides connection info (remote/local IP, ports).
* `ITlsConnectionFeature` → info about the TLS (SSL) connection.
* `IRequestLifetimeFeature` → detects when a request is aborted.
* `IHttpResponseBodyFeature` → controls how the response body is written.

---

### ✅ 3. **Where are Features Used?**

* Inside the `HttpContext.Features` collection:

  ```csharp
  var feature = context.Features.Get<IHttpRequestFeature>();
  ```

---

### ✅ 4. **Custom Feature Example**

* Middleware can **replace or wrap** features:

  ```csharp
  public class CustomMiddleware
  {
      private readonly RequestDelegate _next;

      public CustomMiddleware(RequestDelegate next)
      {
          _next = next;
      }

      public async Task Invoke(HttpContext context)
      {
          var requestFeature = context.Features.Get<IHttpRequestFeature>();
          Console.WriteLine($"Request Path: {requestFeature.Path}");
          await _next(context);
      }
  }
  ```

---

### ✅ 5. **Default Implementations**

* The server (like Kestrel or IIS) provides default feature implementations.
* Middleware and frameworks can **add or override** features.

---

### ✅ 6. **Accessing and Modifying Features**

* Access:

  ```csharp
  var reqFeature = context.Features.Get<IHttpRequestFeature>();
  ```
* Modify:

  ```csharp
  reqFeature.Path = "/new-path";
  ```
* Replace:

  ```csharp
  context.Features.Set<IHttpRequestFeature>(new CustomRequestFeature());
  ```

---

### ✅ 7. **Common Use Cases**

* Create custom middleware for logging, tracing, or metrics.
* Extend request/response pipeline with advanced behaviors.
* Provide compatibility across different hosting environments.

---

### ✅ 8. **Advanced Examples**

* Add custom features:

  ```csharp
  public interface ICustomFeature { string Value { get; set; } }

  public class CustomFeature : ICustomFeature { public string Value { get; set; } }

  app.Use(async (context, next) =>
  {
      context.Features.Set<ICustomFeature>(new CustomFeature { Value = "Hello" });
      await next();
  });
  ```

---

### ✅ 9. **Best Practices**

* Use features when:

  * You need **low-level control**.
  * Middleware needs to collaborate across components.
* Avoid features if high-level APIs (like `HttpContext.Request`) are sufficient.

---

### ✅ 10. **Summary**

* Request features are **low-level building blocks** for HTTP request/response handling.
* They allow fine-grained control over requests and responses.
* You can **read, modify, or replace** features inside middleware.
* Useful for custom pipelines, advanced extensions, and hosting abstraction.

If you want, I can also prepare:
✅ A **sample middleware project with custom features**
✅ A **cheat sheet of common feature interfaces**
✅ A **diagram of how features flow through the pipeline**

Would you like me to prepare one of those? 🚀
