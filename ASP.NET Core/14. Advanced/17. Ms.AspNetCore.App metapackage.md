I currently don't have access to the specific article on "Microsoft.AspNetCore.App for ASP.NET Core" from the Microsoft Docs. However, I can explain the concept based on my knowledge!

Hereâ€™s a **point-by-point explanation** of **Microsoft.AspNetCore.App** in ASP.NET Core:

---

### âœ… **1. What is `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App`?**

* **`Microsoft.AspNetCore.App`** is a **shared framework** for ASP.NET Core applications.
* It includes a set of assemblies that contain the most common **ASP.NET Core libraries** and **frameworks**, such as **MVC**, **Web API**, **SignalR**, **Identity**, **Entity Framework Core**, **Razor**, **Routing**, and more.

---

### âœ… **2. Purpose of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App`**

* The purpose of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` is to simplify the process of referencing common libraries for ASP.NET Core applications.
* It provides an easy way to include essential packages without the need to manually add individual NuGet packages.

---

### âœ… **3. How is `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` Different from `Microsoft.NETCore.App`?**

* **`Microsoft.NETCore.App`** is the shared framework for **.NET Core** applications, which includes basic runtime components and libraries.
* **`Microsoft.AspNetCore.App`** is specifically for **ASP.NET Core** applications and provides additional libraries required for building web applications, APIs, and other web-based services.

---

### âœ… **4. Whatâ€™s Included in `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App`?**

* Some of the common features and libraries included in `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` are:

  * **ASP.NET Core MVC**
  * **ASP.NET Core Web API**
  * **ASP.NET Core SignalR**
  * **ASP.NET Core Identity**
  * **ASP.NET Core Razor Pages**
  * **ASP.NET Core Kestrel web server**
  * **Entity Framework Core (EF Core)**
  * **Logging, Configuration, Dependency Injection**, etc.

By including `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App`, these packages are automatically available in your application.

---

### âœ… **5. How to Use `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App`**

* To use `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App`, you simply need to **target the framework** in your project file (`.csproj`).

Example of a `.csproj` file:

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net5.0</TargetFramework> <!-- or another version -->
    <FrameworkReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.App" />
  </PropertyGroup>

</Project>
```

* By including this `FrameworkReference`, you automatically get access to the assemblies within `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App`, making it easier to start building your ASP.NET Core application.

---

### âœ… **6. Benefits of Using `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App`**

* **Simplifies dependency management**: You donâ€™t have to manually manage individual ASP.NET Core package references.
* **Consistency**: Ensures you are using compatible versions of various ASP.NET Core libraries.
* **Reduced Project Size**: When targeting the shared framework, it minimizes the need for your application to include redundant copies of libraries.

---

### âœ… **7. How to Work with Versioning in `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App`**

* **Versioning**: The version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` is tied to the version of **.NET Core** you're using. For example:

  * For **.NET 5.0**, use `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` version **5.0**.
  * For **.NET 6.0**, use `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` version **6.0**.

* When upgrading your application, ensure that the version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` corresponds to the correct version of the **.NET SDK**.

---

### âœ… **8. Why Choose `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` Over Other Framework References?**

* **Global Availability**: You only need to reference `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` in your `.csproj`, and it includes all necessary ASP.NET Core libraries. This is especially useful for projects that need a wide range of ASP.NET Core functionality.
* **Optimized for Web Applications**: If you're building web applications, APIs, or other web-based systems, `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` provides a comprehensive set of tools that are pre-configured for you.

---

### âœ… **9. Limitations of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App`**

* **Not for all .NET projects**: If you're not building a web application, then referencing `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` might not be necessary. For non-web projects, consider using **`Microsoft.NETCore.App`** or adding only the specific libraries you need.
* **Cannot Update Individual Libraries**: Since `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` includes a set of libraries, you cannot update them individually. If you need more control over the version of specific packages, you'll need to use individual NuGet packages.

---

### âœ… **10. Conclusion**

* **`Microsoft.AspNetCore.App`** simplifies the process of building and deploying web applications by including the essential components required for ASP.NET Core.
* It is ideal for developers who need a pre-configured environment for web projects and want to avoid manually adding individual ASP.NET Core libraries.
