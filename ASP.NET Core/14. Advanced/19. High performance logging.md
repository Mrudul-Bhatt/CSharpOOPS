I don't have access to the specific article on **"High-performance logging in .NET"** from Microsoft Docs. However, I can explain the concept of **high-performance logging** in .NET, especially in the context of ASP.NET Core, based on my knowledge.

Here’s a **point-by-point explanation**:

---

### ✅ **1. What is High-Performance Logging?**

* **High-performance logging** refers to logging operations designed to minimize the impact on the application's performance, especially in high-load scenarios.
* The goal is to ensure that logging does not significantly degrade the overall performance of an application, even when dealing with large amounts of log data.

---

### ✅ **2. Importance of High-Performance Logging**

* **Asynchronous Logging**: In high-performance applications, it's important to log data asynchronously to avoid blocking the main application thread.
* **Non-blocking**: Logging operations should not delay the application's responsiveness, especially in real-time systems.
* **Efficient Resource Use**: Efficient logging reduces CPU and memory overhead, ensuring the application can handle more requests or operations.

---

### ✅ **3. ASP.NET Core Built-in Logging System**

ASP.NET Core provides a **built-in logging system** that is optimized for performance:

* **ILogger Interface**: The main interface used for logging in ASP.NET Core. It allows you to log messages at different levels (e.g., **Trace**, **Debug**, **Information**, **Warning**, **Error**, and **Critical**).
* **Dependency Injection**: ASP.NET Core's built-in logging is integrated with its **Dependency Injection (DI)** system, allowing you to inject `ILogger<T>` into your classes.
* **Log Providers**: ASP.NET Core supports different log providers, including:

  * **Console Logger**: Logs messages to the console.
  * **Debug Logger**: Logs messages to the **Output** window in Visual Studio.
  * **File Logger**: Logs messages to files.
  * **Third-Party Providers**: Such as Serilog, NLog, or Log4Net for more advanced logging needs.

---

### ✅ **4. Asynchronous Logging**

* **Asynchronous** logging is one of the key strategies for high-performance logging, especially for applications that need to handle a high volume of log messages.
* In this approach, logs are written to a buffer or queue and then processed in the background, reducing the impact on the main application workflow.

**Example of asynchronous logging in ASP.NET Core**:

```csharp
public class MyService
{
    private readonly ILogger<MyService> _logger;

    public MyService(ILogger<MyService> logger)
    {
        _logger = logger;
    }

    public async Task DoWorkAsync()
    {
        // Log asynchronously
        await Task.Run(() => _logger.LogInformation("This is an async log message"));
    }
}
```

---

### ✅ **5. Log Filtering**

* **Log filtering** allows you to control which logs are written to outputs based on their log level.
* In ASP.NET Core, you can configure log levels in the `appsettings.json` file or programmatically to prevent logging of less important messages.

**Example of log filtering in `appsettings.json`**:

```json
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft": "Warning",
      "System": "Error"
    }
  }
}
```

---

### ✅ **6. Structured Logging**

* **Structured logging** allows you to log data in a consistent and queryable format (e.g., JSON), making it easier to analyze and process logs later.
* Structured logging is particularly useful in distributed systems and microservices architectures, where logs can be aggregated from multiple sources.

**Example using Serilog for structured logging**:

```csharp
Log.Logger = new LoggerConfiguration()
    .WriteTo.Console(new JsonFormatter())
    .CreateLogger();
```

---

### ✅ **7. Optimizing Log Storage**

* **Log retention policies** should be in place to prevent logs from consuming excessive disk space.
* **Log aggregation tools** like **ElasticSearch** and **Splunk** can be used to aggregate logs in a central location for easy searching and analysis.
* **Compression**: Compressing logs to save space is a common optimization strategy.

---

### ✅ **8. Performance Considerations**

* **Buffering**: Log messages are often written to memory buffers before being flushed to disk or external systems, which helps reduce I/O latency.
* **Thread Pooling**: For high-performance logging, it's crucial to minimize the use of blocking calls. Thread pooling and asynchronous operations can help achieve this.
* **Rate Limiting**: In high-volume applications, log message rate limiting (i.e., limiting how often a log message is written) can help prevent overloading the logging system.

---

### ✅ **9. Use of Third-Party Libraries**

* **Serilog**, **NLog**, and **Log4Net** are popular logging libraries in the .NET ecosystem that provide advanced features such as:

  * **Asynchronous logging**
  * **Log enrichment** (e.g., adding context to logs)
  * **Distributed logging support** (e.g., integrating with systems like ElasticSearch, Splunk, etc.)

**Example using Serilog in ASP.NET Core**:

```csharp
public static IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder(string[] args) =>
    Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
        .ConfigureWebHostDefaults(webBuilder =>
        {
            webBuilder.ConfigureLogging(logging =>
            {
                logging.ClearProviders();
                logging.AddSerilog();
            });
            webBuilder.UseStartup<Startup>();
        });
```

---

### ✅ **10. Monitoring and Troubleshooting with Logs**

* **Real-Time Log Monitoring**: Using tools like **Application Insights** or **Serilog’s Seq** for real-time monitoring can help detect issues early.
* **Alerting**: Set up alerts for specific log events, such as errors or performance degradation.

---

### ✅ **11. Conclusion**

* High-performance logging in ASP.NET Core is essential for maintaining application performance, especially in high-load scenarios.
* Use built-in logging with asynchronous methods and structured logging for optimal performance.
* Consider third-party logging solutions like Serilog, NLog, or Log4Net for more advanced needs.
