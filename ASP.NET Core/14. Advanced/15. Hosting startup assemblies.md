I currently don't have access to the specific article "Use hosting startup assemblies in ASP.NET Core" from the Microsoft Docs, but I can explain the concept based on my knowledge!

Hereâ€™s a **point-by-point explanation** of **using hosting startup assemblies** in ASP.NET Core:

---

### âœ… **1. What are Hosting Startup Assemblies?**

* **Hosting startup assemblies** allow you to add configuration, services, and middleware to your ASP.NET Core application's **hosting environment** at startup.
* These assemblies are part of the **ASP.NET Core hosting infrastructure** and can be used to configure the app's environment before the application itself starts processing requests.

---

### âœ… **2. Why Use Hosting Startup Assemblies?**

* Hosting startup assemblies are primarily useful for **modularizing configuration** and enabling **decoupled configuration** of services.
* They help you to **inject configuration logic** into the applicationâ€™s **host** without modifying the main application code. This is useful for things like:

  * Adding logging providers.
  * Configuring middleware globally.
  * Injecting services during the application startup.

---

### âœ… **3. How Do Hosting Startup Assemblies Work?**

* ASP.NET Core allows the use of **assembly scanning** to automatically find and use startup configurations in your application.
* You can specify one or more **startup assemblies** in your application's hosting environment.
* These assemblies are executed at **application startup** and can interact with the **host builder** to configure the application.

---

### âœ… **4. Defining a Hosting Startup Assembly**

To define a **startup assembly**, you implement a class that **extends** `IHostingStartup` and adds configuration to the host builder.

Example:

```csharp
[assembly: HostingStartup(typeof(MyApp.Startup))]

namespace MyApp
{
    public class Startup : IHostingStartup
    {
        public void Configure(IWebHostBuilder builder)
        {
            // Add services or middleware here
            builder.ConfigureServices((context, services) =>
            {
                // Add custom services
                services.AddSingleton<IMyService, MyService>();
            });
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the class `MyApp.Startup` implements the `IHostingStartup` interface. The `Configure` method is used to **configure the services** when the application starts.

---

### âœ… **5. Registering Hosting Startup Assemblies**

To **register** a hosting startup assembly, the attribute `HostingStartup` is used. You can add this attribute to an assembly to ensure it is discovered during application startup.

Example:

```csharp
[assembly: HostingStartup(typeof(MyApp.Startup))]
```

This tells ASP.NET Core to call the `Configure` method in `MyApp.Startup` during the host setup process.

---

### âœ… **6. Specifying Hosting Startup Assemblies in the App**

* In addition to automatic scanning, you can manually specify hosting startup assemblies in the `Program.cs` file.
* This can be done by configuring the host in `CreateHostBuilder`.

Example:

```csharp
public static IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder(string[] args) =>
    Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
        .ConfigureWebHostDefaults(webBuilder =>
        {
            webBuilder.UseStartup<Startup>();
        })
        .ConfigureHostConfiguration(config =>
        {
            // Adding a custom startup assembly
            config.AddCommandLine(args);
        });
```

---

### âœ… **7. Common Use Cases for Hosting Startup Assemblies**

* **Third-Party Libraries**: Libraries can include a hosting startup assembly to automatically configure services without requiring the user to modify their `Startup.cs` or `Program.cs`.
* **Cross-Cutting Concerns**: Things like logging, error handling, or adding global middleware can be done in startup assemblies to keep the application configuration cleaner.
* **Environment-Specific Configuration**: You can use different hosting startup assemblies for different environments (e.g., development, staging, production) to handle environment-specific configurations.

---

### âœ… **8. When Should You Use Hosting Startup Assemblies?**

* **When you want modular configuration**: Hosting startup assemblies are helpful if you have code that can be reused across multiple applications or if you want to inject services or middleware into your application from an external assembly.
* **When you need to add global configurations**: It's useful for tasks that need to be done across the entire application, such as logging providers, authentication, or metrics.

---

### âœ… **9. How to Troubleshoot Hosting Startup Assemblies**

* If you experience issues with hosting startup assemblies, ensure that:

  * The assembly is correctly loaded and accessible at runtime.
  * The `IHostingStartup` implementation is correct.
  * The hosting assembly is registered properly in the `Program.cs` or via attributes.

---

### âœ… **10. Conclusion**

* Hosting startup assemblies allow for the **modular and dynamic configuration** of your application's **hosting environment** before it starts processing requests.
* They provide a way to **separate concerns** and allow the injection of configuration or middleware logic without modifying the core application code, making your application more flexible and maintainable.
