I don't have access to the specific article on **"Develop ASP.NET Core apps using a file watcher"** from Microsoft Docs. However, I can provide a general explanation based on the concept of using a **file watcher** in the context of **ASP.NET Core** development.

### **Explanation of File Watchers in ASP.NET Core Development**

A **file watcher** in the context of ASP.NET Core development is typically used to monitor changes to files in a project or application directory and automatically trigger actions when changes are detected. This is especially useful during **development** to **auto-reload** or **rebuild** applications in real time.

Here’s a **point-by-point explanation** of how file watchers are commonly used in ASP.NET Core development:

---

### ✅ **1. What is a File Watcher?**

* A **file watcher** monitors changes in specific files or directories in your application.
* It can detect changes like **file creation**, **modification**, or **deletion**.
* In ASP.NET Core, file watchers can be used to trigger actions like **rebuilding** the application or **reloading configurations**.

---

### ✅ **2. Use Cases for File Watchers in ASP.NET Core**

* **Hot Reloading**: Automatically reloads or rebuilds the application when a change is made to source code files or configuration files.
* **Configuration Changes**: Automatically reloads application configurations (e.g., `appsettings.json`) when a change occurs, ensuring the application reflects the new settings.
* **Static File Updates**: Detect changes in static files (like CSS, JavaScript, or images) during development to update the app without requiring a manual reload.

---

### ✅ **3. How File Watchers Work in ASP.NET Core**

* ASP.NET Core has built-in support for file watchers using the **`Microsoft.Extensions.FileProviders`** library.
* It monitors files and directories for changes and provides events such as:

  * **`Changed`**: Triggered when a file is modified.
  * **`Created`**: Triggered when a new file is created.
  * **`Deleted`**: Triggered when a file is deleted.

**Example of file watching using `PhysicalFileProvider`**:

```csharp
public class FileWatcherService
{
    private readonly IFileProvider _fileProvider;

    public FileWatcherService(IWebHostEnvironment environment)
    {
        _fileProvider = new PhysicalFileProvider(environment.ContentRootPath);
    }

    public void StartWatching()
    {
        var changeToken = _fileProvider.Watch("myFile.txt");

        changeToken.RegisterChangeCallback(state =>
        {
            Console.WriteLine("File changed!");
        }, null);
    }
}
```

### ✅ **4. Using File Watchers in ASP.NET Core with `dotnet watch`**

* **`dotnet watch`** is a command-line tool that automatically rebuilds and restarts the application when file changes are detected in the project.
* It's commonly used during development for a seamless experience without needing to manually restart the application.

**Example**:

* Run `dotnet watch run` from the terminal in the project directory.
* When you modify a file (e.g., a C# file or a Razor page), the application will automatically restart to reflect the changes.

---

### ✅ **5. File Watcher in Development vs. Production**

* **Development Environment**: In development, a file watcher is typically used for **automatic application reloads**, **config changes**, and **debugging** purposes. Tools like **dotnet watch** can be utilized for **hot-reloading** of code.
* **Production Environment**: File watchers are less commonly used in production, but they can still be useful for monitoring configuration files or content updates that should trigger application actions (e.g., reloading config or refreshing cached data).

---

### ✅ **6. Performance Considerations**

* File watchers can be resource-intensive, especially when monitoring large numbers of files or directories.
* It's important to ensure that file watchers are used efficiently and only in the appropriate environments (e.g., avoid using them in production unless necessary).
* You should limit the number of directories and files being watched to minimize performance overhead.

---

### ✅ **7. How to Configure File Watchers**

* ASP.NET Core uses the **`FileSystemWatcher`** class internally (via the **`PhysicalFileProvider`**) to watch for file changes.
* You can configure a file watcher to:

  * **Watch specific directories or files**: You can specify which files or directories to watch.
  * **Trigger custom actions**: For example, you can trigger specific actions when configuration files change or new resources are added.

---

### ✅ **8. Practical Example of File Watcher for Configuration Changes**

* In an ASP.NET Core application, you might want to reload configurations whenever a configuration file (e.g., `appsettings.json`) is changed. This can be achieved using a file watcher.

**Example**:

```csharp
public class ConfigurationReloadingService
{
    private readonly IFileProvider _fileProvider;
    private readonly IConfiguration _configuration;

    public ConfigurationReloadingService(IFileProvider fileProvider, IConfiguration configuration)
    {
        _fileProvider = fileProvider;
        _configuration = configuration;
    }

    public void StartWatching()
    {
        var changeToken = _fileProvider.Watch("appsettings.json");

        changeToken.RegisterChangeCallback(state =>
        {
            // Reload configuration when the file changes
            _configuration.Reload();
            Console.WriteLine("Configuration file changed and reloaded!");
        }, null);
    }
}
```

---

### ✅ **9. Debugging and Troubleshooting with File Watchers**

* When working with file watchers, you can log changes to help monitor when certain files or directories are being modified.
* Ensure proper logging is in place to debug any issues related to file watching, such as not triggering events when files change.

---

### ✅ **10. Conclusion**

* File watchers are useful tools for improving development workflows in ASP.NET Core.
* They automate the process of reflecting changes in real time, allowing developers to focus on building applications without having to manually restart or reload the application.
