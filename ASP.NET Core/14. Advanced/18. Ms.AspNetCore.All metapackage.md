I don't have access to the specific document for the **"Microsoft.AspNetCore.All metapackage for ASP.NET Core 2.0"** from the Microsoft Docs. However, based on my knowledge, I can explain the concept of the **`Microsoft.AspNetCore.All`** metapackage and how it was used in **ASP.NET Core 2.0**.

Here’s a **point-by-point explanation**:

---

### ✅ **1. What is `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All`?**

* **`Microsoft.AspNetCore.All`** was a **metapackage** in **ASP.NET Core 2.0**.
* It was a package that bundled all the essential **ASP.NET Core libraries** required for web application development into one reference.
* It simplified the process of setting up an ASP.NET Core project by automatically including libraries such as **ASP.NET Core MVC**, **Web API**, **Entity Framework Core**, and more.

---

### ✅ **2. Purpose of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All`**

* **Simplified Dependency Management**: Instead of manually adding multiple individual NuGet packages, developers could reference this single package to include essential libraries.
* It was meant to provide all commonly used ASP.NET Core functionality, making it easy to get started with web development.

---

### ✅ **3. Key Libraries Included in `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All`**

* The **`Microsoft.AspNetCore.All`** metapackage included:

  * **ASP.NET Core MVC**: For building web applications using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern.
  * **ASP.NET Core Web API**: For building RESTful web APIs.
  * **ASP.NET Core SignalR**: For real-time web functionality.
  * **ASP.NET Core Identity**: For handling authentication and authorization.
  * **Entity Framework Core (EF Core)**: For database access and ORM functionality.
  * **ASP.NET Core Razor Pages**: For building web pages.
  * **Kestrel Web Server**: The default cross-platform web server for ASP.NET Core.
  * **Dependency Injection, Configuration, Logging**, and more.

---

### ✅ **4. How to Use `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All`**

* To use `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All`, you only needed to add the following in your `.csproj` file.

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.All" Version="2.0.0" />
  </PropertyGroup>

</Project>
```

* This single reference would include all necessary ASP.NET Core libraries for your project.

---

### ✅ **5. Benefits of Using `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All`**

* **Convenience**: It made it easier for developers to get started quickly without needing to manage each individual package.
* **Consistency**: Ensured that all included libraries were compatible with each other since they came from the same package.
* **Less Setup Overhead**: Developers could focus on building their application rather than managing dependencies.

---

### ✅ **6. Deprecation of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All`**

* Starting with **ASP.NET Core 3.0**, the **`Microsoft.AspNetCore.All`** metapackage was **deprecated**.
* The new approach in **ASP.NET Core 3.0** and later was to **reference specific packages** as needed, rather than using a broad metapackage. This allowed for:

  * **More Control**: Developers could include only the libraries they needed, reducing unnecessary dependencies.
  * **Smaller Application Size**: By using individual packages, applications could avoid bundling unnecessary libraries, leading to smaller application sizes.

---

### ✅ **7. Transition from `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All`**

* When migrating to **ASP.NET Core 3.0 or later**:

  * You would need to **remove the reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All`**.
  * Instead, **add specific package references** for the libraries required by your application (e.g., `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`, `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore`).
  * This approach ensured greater flexibility and customization of the project setup.

---

### ✅ **8. Conclusion**

* The **`Microsoft.AspNetCore.All`** metapackage in **ASP.NET Core 2.0** was a great convenience for developers, offering an easy and quick way to include all necessary ASP.NET Core libraries for building web applications.
* However, starting with **ASP.NET Core 3.0**, the metapackage was deprecated, and individual library references became the preferred method for managing dependencies in ASP.NET Core projects.
