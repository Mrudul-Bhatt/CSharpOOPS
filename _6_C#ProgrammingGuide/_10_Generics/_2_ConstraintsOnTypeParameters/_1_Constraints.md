### Explanation: Constraints on Type Parameters in C#

Constraints in generics provide the compiler with specific information about the capabilities that a type argument must have when it is used in a generic class, method, or structure. Without constraints, the compiler assumes only the capabilities of `System.Object`, which means no specific methods or properties of a type are guaranteed to exist. By using constraints, you ensure the type argument meets specific requirements, leading to safer and more predictable generic code.

### Why Use Constraints?

Constraints enable the compiler to:
- Validate the type arguments provided by client code.
- Ensure type safety by limiting operations to those supported by the constrained type.
- Optimize performance by reducing runtime type checks.

### Common Constraints and Their Descriptions

1. **`where T : struct`**  
   - Ensures `T` is a non-nullable **value type** (e.g., `int`, `double`, or custom structs).
   - Implies that the type has a parameterless constructor, so it cannot be combined with the `new()` constraint.
   - Example:
     ```csharp
     public class ValueTypeHolder<T> where T : struct
     {
         public T Value { get; set; }
     }
     ```

2. **`where T : class` / `where T : class?`**  
   - Ensures `T` is a **reference type**.  
     - `class` requires a non-nullable reference type.
     - `class?` allows nullable and non-nullable reference types.
   - Example:
     ```csharp
     public class ReferenceTypeHolder<T> where T : class
     {
         public T Reference { get; set; }
     }
     ```

3. **`where T : notnull`**  
   - Ensures `T` is a **non-nullable type**, which could be either a value type or a non-nullable reference type.

4. **`where T : unmanaged`**  
   - Ensures `T` is a non-nullable **unmanaged type**, such as primitive types, pointers, or structs containing only unmanaged types.
   - Implies the `struct` constraint, so it cannot be combined with it.

5. **`where T : new()`**  
   - Ensures `T` has a **public parameterless constructor**.
   - Must be the **last constraint** in a list if combined with others.
   - Example:
     ```csharp
     public class Factory<T> where T : new()
     {
         public T CreateInstance()
         {
             return new T();
         }
     }
     ```

6. **`where T : <base class name>` or `where T : <base class name>?`**  
   - Ensures `T` inherits from a specific **base class**.  
     - `Base` ensures `T` is a non-nullable type derived from the base class.
     - `Base?` allows nullable and non-nullable types derived from the base class.
   - Example:
     ```csharp
     public class DerivedClassHolder<T> where T : MyBaseClass
     {
         public T DerivedInstance { get; set; }
     }
     ```

7. **`where T : <interface name>` or `where T : <interface name>?`**  
   - Ensures `T` implements a specific **interface**. Multiple interfaces can be specified.

8. **`where T : U`**  
   - Ensures `T` is of the same type as or derives from the type argument `U`.

9. **`where T : default`**  
   - Ensures the type parameter resolves ambiguities in overrides or interface implementations without using `struct` or `class` constraints.

10. **`where T : allows ref struct`**  
    - Ensures `T` can be a `ref struct` type and adheres to ref safety rules.

---

### Rules and Order of Constraints

- At most **one of `struct`, `class`, `class?`, `notnull`, or `unmanaged`** can be applied.
- Constraints must appear in the following order:
  1. `struct`, `class`, `class?`, `notnull`, `unmanaged` (if any).
  2. Base class or base class with nullable (`Base` or `Base?`).
  3. Interface constraints.
  4. `new()` constraint (always last).
  5. Anti-constraints like `allows ref struct`.

### Examples of Usage

#### Multiple Constraints
```csharp
public class MultiConstraintExample<T>
    where T : class, IComparable, new()
{
    public T CreateAndCompare(T other)
    {
        T instance = new T();
        if (instance.CompareTo(other) > 0)
            return instance;
        return other;
    }
}
```

#### Ref Struct Constraint
```csharp
public class RefStructExample<T> where T : allows ref struct
{
    public void Process(T item) { /*...*/ }
}
```

### Summary
Constraints in generics define the capabilities a type parameter must satisfy, ensuring type safety, reusability, and predictability. By using constraints, you guide both the compiler and the client code to work with generic types that meet specific requirements, avoiding runtime errors and ensuring efficient execution.
