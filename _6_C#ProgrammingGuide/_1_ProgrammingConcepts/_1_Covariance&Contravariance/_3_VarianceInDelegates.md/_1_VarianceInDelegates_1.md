### **Variance in Delegates (C#)**

In C#, **variance** in delegates refers to the ability to assign methods with a signature that is more flexible than the delegate's type, allowing for greater type compatibility. This feature was introduced in **.NET Framework 3.5** and allows delegates to accept methods where:
- **Covariance** enables the return type of a method to be more derived than the type defined in the delegate.
- **Contravariance** allows the methodâ€™s parameters to be less derived than those defined in the delegate.

These concepts enable methods and delegates to be more flexible and reusable, especially when dealing with inheritance hierarchies.

### **1. Covariance and Contravariance in Delegates**

- **Covariant Delegate** (`out` keyword):
  - This allows a delegate to point to methods whose return type is more derived than the one specified by the delegate.
  - Example: A delegate of type `SampleDelegate<First>` can point to a method that returns a more derived type, such as `Second` (where `Second` is derived from `First`).

- **Contravariant Delegate** (`in` keyword):
  - This allows a delegate to point to methods that accept parameters of less derived types than the delegate specifies.
  - Example: A delegate of type `SampleDelegate<Second>` can point to a method that takes `First` as a parameter.

### **2. Covariance in Delegate Examples**

Consider the following class hierarchy and delegate definitions:

```csharp
public class First { }  
public class Second : First { }  
public delegate First SampleDelegate(Second a);  
public delegate R SampleGenericDelegate<A, R>(A a);
```

You can assign different methods with compatible signatures to these delegates, and variance ensures that you can work with more derived return types or less derived parameter types.

#### **Matching Method Signature**
```csharp
public static First ASecondRFirst(Second second)  
{ return new First(); }
```

#### **More Derived Return Type**
```csharp
public static Second ASecondRSecond(Second second)  
{ return new Second(); }
```

#### **Less Derived Argument Type**
```csharp
public static First AFirstRFirst(First first)  
{ return new First(); }
```

#### **More Derived Return Type and Less Derived Argument Type**
```csharp
public static Second AFirstRSecond(First first)  
{ return new Second(); }
```

#### **Assigning Methods to Delegates**
Now, we assign methods to delegates that demonstrate implicit conversions allowed by covariance and contravariance:

```csharp
// Assigning a method with a matching signature
SampleDelegate dNonGeneric = ASecondRFirst;  

// Assigning a method with a more derived return type
// and less derived argument type
SampleDelegate dNonGenericConversion = AFirstRSecond;  

// Assigning a method with a matching signature to a generic delegate
SampleGenericDelegate<Second, First> dGeneric = ASecondRFirst;  

// Assigning a method with a more derived return type
// and less derived argument type to a generic delegate
SampleGenericDelegate<Second, First> dGenericConversion = AFirstRSecond;  
```

Here, the compiler handles the implicit conversion between methods and delegates, even when their types differ in terms of inheritance hierarchy (via variance).

### **3. Variance in Generic Delegates (Covariant and Contravariant)**

In **.NET Framework 4**, variance support extends to generic delegates, allowing more flexibility in how methods can be assigned to delegates.

- **Covariant Delegates**: You can mark the generic type parameter as covariant using the `out` keyword. This allows assignment of delegates where the return type of a method is more derived than the delegate's generic type.
  
  ```csharp
  public delegate T SampleGenericDelegate <out T>();  
  
  public static void Test()  
  {  
      SampleGenericDelegate<String> dString = () => " ";  
      SampleGenericDelegate<Object> dObject = dString;  // Covariance allows this assignment
  }
  ```

- **Contravariant Delegates**: If you mark the parameter type as contravariant using the `in` keyword, you can assign a method that takes a less derived type than the one specified in the delegate.

#### **Example of Contravariance Issue Without the `out` Keyword**
```csharp
public delegate T SampleGenericDelegate<T>();  
  
public static void Test()  
{  
    SampleGenericDelegate<String> dString = () => " ";  
    SampleGenericDelegate<Object> dObject = () => " ";  
  
    // Compiler error without covariance support
    // SampleGenericDelegate<Object> dObject = dString;  
}
```
This error occurs because the generic parameter isn't explicitly marked as covariant with `out`. Using the `out` keyword allows implicit conversion between `SampleGenericDelegate<String>` and `SampleGenericDelegate<Object>`.

### **4. Variant Type Parameters in Built-In Generic Delegates**

.NET Framework 4 introduced variance support for several existing generic delegates:

- **Action Delegates**: `Action<T>`, `Action<T1, T2>`, etc. (no return value)
- **Func Delegates**: `Func<TResult>`, `Func<T, TResult>`, etc. (with return value)
- **Predicate<T>**: Represents a method that checks a condition on a type `T`.
- **Comparison<T>**: Compares two objects of type `T`.
- **Converter<TInput, TOutput>**: Converts an object of type `TInput` to `TOutput`.

These delegates now support variance for generic type parameters, making them more flexible when working with derived types.

### **5. Summary**
- **Variance in delegates** (covariance and contravariance) allows greater flexibility in matching methods with delegate types.
- You can use **covariance** to assign methods with more derived return types to delegates, and **contravariance** to assign methods with less derived argument types.
- The `out` and `in` keywords enable this flexibility for generic delegates, and the **.NET Framework 4** supports implicit conversion between delegates with variant type parameters. This makes delegate-based programming more robust and adaptable to inheritance hierarchies.

By leveraging variance, you can write more reusable, type-safe, and flexible code when working with delegates in C#.
