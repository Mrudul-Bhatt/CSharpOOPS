### **Explanation: Restricting Accessor Accessibility**

#### **Overview of Accessors**
Properties and indexers in C# have `get` and `set` accessors:
- **`get`**: Retrieves the value of the property.
- **`set`**: Assigns a value to the property.

By default, both accessors have the same accessibility as the property or indexer. However, you can **restrict access** to one accessor by explicitly applying a more restrictive access modifier.

For example, a property may have:
- A **public `get` accessor** to allow reading.
- A **protected `set` accessor** to limit writing to derived classes.

### **Key Concepts of Restricting Accessor Accessibility**

#### **1. Restricting `set` Accessibility**
You can restrict access to the `set` accessor while leaving the `get` accessor publicly accessible. This is useful for creating **read-only properties from outside** the class.

Example:
```csharp
private string _name = "Hello";

public string Name
{
    get => _name; // Publicly accessible
    protected set => _name = value; // Restricted to derived classes
}
```
Here:
- Any code can **read** `Name` because `get` is public.
- Only the class itself or its derived classes can **modify** `Name` because `set` is protected.

---

#### **2. Rules for Using Accessor Modifiers**
When applying different access modifiers to `get` and `set` accessors:
1. The property must have **both `get` and `set` accessors**.
2. You can apply an access modifier to only **one** of the accessors.
3. The **access modifier on the accessor must be more restrictive** than the property’s access level.
   - For example, a `protected set` on a `public` property is valid.
   - But a `public set` on a `private` property is not allowed.

---

#### **3. Restrictions with Interfaces and Overrides**
- **Interfaces**: Accessor modifiers cannot be used in interface declarations.
  - Example: 
    ```csharp
    public interface ISomeInterface
    {
        int TestProperty { get; } // No access modifiers allowed.
    }
    ```

- **Overrides**: When overriding a property or indexer, the accessibility of the overridden accessor must **match the base class accessor**.

Example:
```csharp
public class Parent
{
    public virtual int TestProperty
    {
        protected set { }
        get { return 0; }
    }
}

public class Child : Parent
{
    public override int TestProperty
    {
        protected set { } // Matches parent accessibility
        get { return 0; }
    }
}
```

---

#### **4. Example: Accessor Accessibility Domain**
- If a property uses an explicit access modifier on its accessor:
  - The **accessibility domain** of that accessor is defined by the modifier.
- If no explicit modifier is used:
  - The **accessibility domain** is determined by the property’s access level.

---

### **Example Walkthrough**

#### **Example 1: Restricting Access to `set`**

```csharp
public class Employee
{
    private string _name;

    public string Name
    {
        get => _name;        // Public get accessor
        private set => _name = value; // Private set accessor
    }

    public Employee(string name)
    {
        Name = name; // Allowed because `set` is private and accessible within the class.
    }
}
```

- **Key Points**:
  - External code can only **read** the `Name` property, not modify it.
  - Only the class itself can **modify** the `Name` using the `private set`.

---

#### **Example 2: Hiding Base Class Properties**
In the following example, the derived class **hides** properties from the base class using `new` and restricts accessibility with `protected` or `private`.

```csharp
public class BaseClass
{
    public string Id { get; set; } = "ID-BaseClass";
}

public class DerivedClass : BaseClass
{
    private string _id = "ID-DerivedClass";

    // Hides the base property
    new private string Id
    {
        get => _id;
        set => _id = value;
    }
}
```

In the `MainClass`, assigning a value to the `Id` property of `DerivedClass` will access the `Id` property from `BaseClass` because the `Id` in `DerivedClass` is private:
```csharp
BaseClass b1 = new BaseClass();
DerivedClass d1 = new DerivedClass();

b1.Id = "Base-ID";   // Uses BaseClass.Id
d1.Id = "Derived-ID"; // Uses BaseClass.Id because DerivedClass.Id is private
```

### **Key Takeaways**

1. **Accessor Modifiers**: Use different access levels on `get` and `set` to control accessibility, e.g., `public get` and `protected set`.
2. **Restrictions**:
   - You must define both `get` and `set` to use modifiers.
   - The modifier must be **more restrictive** than the property’s overall access level.
3. **Hiding vs Overriding**:
   - Use `new` to explicitly hide base properties.
   - Use `override` to redefine base properties.
4. **Use Cases**:
   - Restrict `set` access to prevent modification outside the class or its derived types.
   - Provide **read-only properties** for external consumers while maintaining internal mutability.
