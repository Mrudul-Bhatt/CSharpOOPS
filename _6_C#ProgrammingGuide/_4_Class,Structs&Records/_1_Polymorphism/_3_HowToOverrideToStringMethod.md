In C#, every class or struct implicitly inherits from the `Object` class, which includes a `ToString()` method. This method returns a string representation of an object. By default, the `ToString()` method returns the fully qualified name of the object's type. However, in most cases, you will want to override this method to provide a more meaningful string representation of your custom classes or structs.

### Key Points:
1. **Inheritance from `Object`**: Every object in C# inherits the `ToString()` method from the `Object` class. For example, the `int` type, which is a value type, has a `ToString()` method that converts the integer to its string equivalent.
   ```csharp
   int x = 42;
   string strx = x.ToString();  // Converts the integer to the string "42"
   Console.WriteLine(strx);  // Output: 42
   ```

2. **Overriding `ToString()`**: When you create custom classes or structs, it's common to override the `ToString()` method to provide a string that represents the instance's data in a human-readable form. The `ToString()` method is declared with the `override` modifier and returns a `string`.
   ```csharp
   public override string ToString()
   {
       // Custom implementation
   }
   ```

3. **Custom Implementation Example**: Below is an example where we define a `Person` class and override the `ToString()` method to return a meaningful string that includes the `Name` and `Age` properties of the `Person` instance.
   ```csharp
   class Person
   {
       public string Name { get; set; }
       public int Age { get; set; }

       public override string ToString()
       {
           return "Person: " + Name + " " + Age;
       }
   }
   ```
   When an instance of `Person` is created and printed, the overridden `ToString()` method is called to display the custom string:
   ```csharp
   Person person = new Person { Name = "John", Age = 12 };
   Console.WriteLine(person);  // Output: Person: John 12
   ```

4. **Why Override `ToString()`?**: 
   - **Improved Debugging and Logging**: Overriding `ToString()` helps in debugging and logging by providing a human-readable representation of the object's state.
   - **Customization**: It allows you to control exactly how the object is represented when it's converted to a string (e.g., for display purposes in a UI).
   - **Format Control**: You can also implement custom formatting inside `ToString()` using format strings, which can be helpful when dealing with numbers, dates, or other specific types.

5. **Important Security Consideration**: When overriding the `ToString()` method, be cautious about exposing sensitive data, especially if the class might be used by untrusted code. Avoid including sensitive or private data that could be exploited by malicious users.

### Example with Custom Formatting:
You can also use custom formatting when implementing `ToString()`. For example, if you want to format a date or a number, you can use format strings like this:
```csharp
class Product
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public decimal Price { get; set; }

    public override string ToString()
    {
        return $"Product: {Name}, Price: {Price:C2}";  // Format the price as currency
    }
}

Product product = new Product { Name = "Laptop", Price = 999.99M };
Console.WriteLine(product);  // Output: Product: Laptop, Price: $999.99
```

In summary, overriding the `ToString()` method is a simple and effective way to provide meaningful and customized string representations for your objects in C#.
