This example illustrates how to use the `new` and `override` keywords in C# to handle method hiding and method overriding, respectively, when dealing with inheritance.

### Key Concepts:
- **`new` Keyword**: This is used to hide a method from the base class in a derived class, which is a form of name hiding. It doesn't change the behavior of the method when the base class type is used, but it allows the derived class to have a different implementation when the object is referred to as the derived type.
  
- **`override` Keyword**: This allows the derived class to extend or change the behavior of a method that is marked as `virtual` or `abstract` in the base class. The `override` keyword ensures that the method is called based on the actual runtime type of the object, even when it's referenced by a base class type.

### Example Breakdown:
1. **Base Class (`Car`)**: This class defines two methods:
   - `DescribeCar()`: Prints basic information about a car, then calls the `ShowDetails()` method.
   - `ShowDetails()`: This method is `virtual`, meaning it can be overridden or hidden in derived classes.

2. **Derived Classes**:
   - **`ConvertibleCar`**: Uses the `new` keyword to hide the `ShowDetails()` method from the base class. This means if an object of type `ConvertibleCar` is referred to as `Car`, the base class method will be used.
   - **`Minivan`**: Uses the `override` keyword to extend the behavior of the `ShowDetails()` method. This ensures that the `ShowDetails()` method defined in the `Minivan` class is used regardless of the reference type (whether it is `Car` or `Minivan`).

### Method Calls and Behavior:
- **`TestCars1()`**: Tests `DescribeCar()` with different object types.
  - `Car` calls `ShowDetails()` from `Car` (base class).
  - `ConvertibleCar` calls `ShowDetails()` from `Car` even though the `ConvertibleCar` has its own version of `ShowDetails` because the method is hidden using `new`.
  - `Minivan` calls `ShowDetails()` from `Minivan` because the method is overridden using `override`.

- **`TestCars2()`**: Tests a list of cars (including `Car`, `ConvertibleCar`, and `Minivan` objects). Even though the list is of type `Car`, the actual method called depends on the runtime type:
  - `Car` calls the method in `Car`.
  - `ConvertibleCar` still calls the method in `Car` (because of `new`).
  - `Minivan` calls the method in `Minivan` (because of `override`).

- **`TestCars3()`**: Calls `ShowDetails()` directly from `ConvertibleCar` and `Minivan` objects. Since these objects are declared as their respective types, the correct `ShowDetails()` is called:
  - `ConvertibleCar` calls its own version of `ShowDetails`.
  - `Minivan` calls its own version of `ShowDetails`.

- **`TestCars4()`**: Calls `ShowDetails()` directly from `Car` objects, which are instantiated as `ConvertibleCar` and `Minivan`. The actual method that gets called depends on the runtime type:
  - For `ConvertibleCar`, `ShowDetails()` from the base class (`Car`) is called because `new` was used.
  - For `Minivan`, `ShowDetails()` from the derived class (`Minivan`) is called because `override` was used.

### Key Output Differences:
- For `ConvertibleCar` (in both `TestCars1` and `TestCars2`), the method from the base class (`Car`) is called due to the use of the `new` modifier.
- For `Minivan`, the method from the derived class (`Minivan`) is always called, thanks to the `override` modifier.

This example helps illustrate the difference between hiding methods with `new` and overriding them with `override` in the context of inheritance and polymorphism in C#.



You're right! I missed providing the reference code from the previous explanation. Here's the full code for both the **`new`** and **`override`** keywords, along with the output they produce.

### Full Code Example for `new` vs `override`:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace OverrideAndNewExample
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Test which version of ShowDetails is called in different scenarios
            TestCars1();
            TestCars2();
            TestCars3();
            TestCars4();
        }

        // Test the DescribeCar method and which ShowDetails method is called
        public static void TestCars1()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("\nTestCars1");
            Console.WriteLine("----------");

            Car car1 = new Car();
            car1.DescribeCar();  // Calls Car's DescribeCar and ShowDetails
            Console.WriteLine("----------");

            ConvertibleCar car2 = new ConvertibleCar();
            car2.DescribeCar();  // Calls Car's DescribeCar and ConvertibleCar's ShowDetails (due to `new`)
            Console.WriteLine("----------");

            Minivan car3 = new Minivan();
            car3.DescribeCar();  // Calls Car's DescribeCar and Minivan's ShowDetails (due to `override`)
            Console.WriteLine("----------");
        }

        // Test DescribeCar for a list of Car, ConvertibleCar, and Minivan objects
        public static void TestCars2()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("\nTestCars2");
            Console.WriteLine("----------");

            var cars = new List<Car> { new Car(), new ConvertibleCar(), new Minivan() };

            foreach (var car in cars)
            {
                car.DescribeCar();  // Demonstrates which ShowDetails is called
                Console.WriteLine("----------");
            }
        }

        // Directly call ShowDetails from ConvertibleCar and Minivan instances
        public static void TestCars3()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("\nTestCars3");
            Console.WriteLine("----------");

            ConvertibleCar car2 = new ConvertibleCar();
            Minivan car3 = new Minivan();
            car2.ShowDetails();  // Calls ConvertibleCar's ShowDetails
            car3.ShowDetails();  // Calls Minivan's ShowDetails
        }

        // Directly call ShowDetails from Car objects instantiated with derived types
        public static void TestCars4()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("\nTestCars4");
            Console.WriteLine("----------");

            Car car2 = new ConvertibleCar();
            Car car3 = new Minivan();
            car2.ShowDetails();  // Calls Car's ShowDetails (due to `new` modifier in ConvertibleCar)
            car3.ShowDetails();  // Calls Minivan's ShowDetails (due to `override`)
        }
    }

    // Base class Car
    class Car
    {
        public virtual void DescribeCar()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Four wheels and an engine.");
            ShowDetails();  // Calls ShowDetails, which will differ in derived classes
        }

        public virtual void ShowDetails()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Standard transportation.");
        }
    }

    // Derived class ConvertibleCar using the `new` modifier to hide base class ShowDetails
    class ConvertibleCar : Car
    {
        public new void ShowDetails()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("A roof that opens up.");
        }
    }

    // Derived class Minivan using the `override` modifier to extend base class ShowDetails
    class Minivan : Car
    {
        public override void ShowDetails()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Carries seven people.");
        }
    }
}
```

### Output:

```
TestCars1
----------
Four wheels and an engine.
Standard transportation.

```

### Explanation of Key Points:

1. **TestCars1**:
   - **Car**: Calls the `DescribeCar` method from the `Car` class, which in turn calls `ShowDetails()` from the `Car` class.
   - **ConvertibleCar**: Calls the `DescribeCar` method from the `Car` class, but because `ShowDetails()` is hidden (with the `new` modifier), the version from the `Car` class is called instead of the `ConvertibleCar` version.
   - **Minivan**: Calls the `DescribeCar` method from the `Car` class, and since the `ShowDetails()` method is overridden in `Minivan`, it calls the `Minivan` version.

2. **TestCars2**:
   - A list of `Car` objects is created with `Car`, `ConvertibleCar`, and `Minivan`. The same pattern occurs as in `TestCars1`: `ShowDetails` from `Car` is called for `ConvertibleCar` objects (because of the `new` keyword), and `Minivan` calls the overridden method.

3. **TestCars3**:
   - Calls `ShowDetails()` directly on instances of `ConvertibleCar` and `Minivan`. Here, `ConvertibleCar` calls its own version of `ShowDetails`, and `Minivan` calls the overridden method.

4. **TestCars4**:
   - This case demonstrates how calling `ShowDetails()` directly on objects declared as `Car` (but instantiated with derived types) behaves. `ConvertibleCar` calls the base class version due to the `new` modifier, while `Minivan` calls the overridden method.

### Key Modifiers:
- **`new`**: Used to hide a method in a derived class without overriding the base class method. In the example, `ConvertibleCar` uses `new` to hide `ShowDetails` from the `Car` class.
- **`override`**: Used to override a method in a derived class. In the example, `Minivan` uses `override` to provide a new implementation of `ShowDetails` that extends the base class functionality.

This should now give you a complete picture of how `new` and `override` behave in different contexts.
