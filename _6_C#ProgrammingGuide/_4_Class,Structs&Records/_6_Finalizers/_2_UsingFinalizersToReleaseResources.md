### **Using Finalizers to Release Resources**

In C#, the **garbage collector (GC)** automatically manages memory allocation and release, making manual memory management less necessary than in non-GC languages. However, for **unmanaged resources** like file handles, sockets, or database connections, developers need to explicitly handle cleanup to ensure resources are freed properly. **Finalizers** serve as a mechanism to release unmanaged resources when an object is garbage collected.

### **Explicit Release of Resources: Using `Dispose`**

While finalizers provide a backup mechanism for resource cleanup, they are **non-deterministic**, meaning you can't control exactly when they run. Therefore, it's recommended to provide an **explicit cleanup mechanism** by implementing the `Dispose` method from the `IDisposable` interface. This approach allows developers to release resources deterministically, improving application performance.

### **Best Practice: Combining Finalizers and `Dispose`**
1. **`Dispose` for Explicit Cleanup**: Allow consumers of your class to explicitly release resources as soon as they are no longer needed.
2. **Finalizers as a Safety Net**: Use a finalizer as a backup to release resources in case `Dispose` is not called.

---

### **Example: Explicit Cleanup with Finalizer and `Dispose`**

```csharp
class ResourceHandler : IDisposable
{
    private IntPtr unmanagedResource; // Example unmanaged resource
    private bool disposed = false;

    public ResourceHandler()
    {
        // Simulate acquiring an unmanaged resource
        unmanagedResource = new IntPtr(42);
        Console.WriteLine("Unmanaged resource acquired.");
    }

    // Finalizer
    ~ResourceHandler()
    {
        // Backup cleanup in case Dispose isn't called
        Dispose(false);
        Console.WriteLine("Finalizer executed.");
    }

    // Dispose method for explicit cleanup
    public void Dispose()
    {
        Dispose(true);
        GC.SuppressFinalize(this); // Prevent finalizer from running
    }

    protected virtual void Dispose(bool disposing)
    {
        if (!disposed)
        {
            if (disposing)
            {
                // Release managed resources if any
                Console.WriteLine("Managed resources cleaned up.");
            }

            // Release unmanaged resources
            if (unmanagedResource != IntPtr.Zero)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Unmanaged resource released.");
                unmanagedResource = IntPtr.Zero;
            }

            disposed = true;
        }
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        using (var handler = new ResourceHandler())
        {
            // Use the resource handler
        }
        // Resource released deterministically via Dispose
    }
}
```

### **Output**
```
Unmanaged resource acquired.
Managed resources cleaned up.
Unmanaged resource released.
```

If `Dispose` is not called, the **finalizer** will eventually clean up the unmanaged resource, but this occurs non-deterministically.

### **Finalizer Behavior in Inheritance Chains**

Finalizers are called in reverse order of the inheritance hierarchy, starting with the most-derived class and moving to the base class. If you define finalizers in a class hierarchy, ensure proper cleanup in each class to avoid resource leaks.

### **Example: Finalizers in an Inheritance Chain**

```csharp
class First
{
    ~First()
    {
        System.Diagnostics.Trace.WriteLine("First's finalizer is called.");
    }
}

class Second : First
{
    ~Second()
    {
        System.Diagnostics.Trace.WriteLine("Second's finalizer is called.");
    }
}

class Third : Second
{
    ~Third()
    {
        System.Diagnostics.Trace.WriteLine("Third's finalizer is called.");
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Third t = new Third();
        t = null;

        // Force garbage collection (for demonstration purposes)
        GC.Collect();
        GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers();
    }
}
```

### **Output (in .NET Framework)**:
```
Third's finalizer is called.
Second's finalizer is called.
First's finalizer is called.
```

### **Behavior in .NET 5 and Later**
In .NET 5 (including .NET Core) and later versions, finalizers are **not guaranteed to run** when the application terminates. To ensure cleanup during application exit, you should:
1. Register a handler for the `AppDomain.ProcessExit` event.
2. Implement `IDisposable` to explicitly clean up resources.

---

### **Key Recommendations for Using Finalizers**
1. **Avoid Excessive Use**: Use finalizers only when working with unmanaged resources that aren't wrapped in a safe handle.
2. **Combine with `Dispose`**: Implement the `Dispose` pattern for deterministic cleanup and use finalizers as a safety net.
3. **Suppress Finalization**: Call `GC.SuppressFinalize` after resources are explicitly released via `Dispose`.
4. **Performance Impact**: Finalizers delay garbage collection and increase GC workload. Only include necessary cleanup logic.
