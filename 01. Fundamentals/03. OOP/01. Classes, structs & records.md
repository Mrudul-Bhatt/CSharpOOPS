Sure, let's explore the "Overview of Object-Oriented Techniques in C#" deeply, drawing heavily from the principles and examples commonly found in Microsoft's official documentation. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a paradigm that structures software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. C# is a fundamentally object-oriented language, and understanding its OOP features is crucial for building robust, scalable, and maintainable applications.

## Overview of Object-Oriented Techniques in C#: A Deep Dive

The core idea behind OOP is to model real-world entities (objects) and their interactions. In C#, this is achieved through several key principles:

1.  **Encapsulation:** Bundling data (fields/properties) and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (a class), and controlling access to that data.
2.  **Abstraction:** Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object.
3.  **Inheritance:** Allowing new classes to reuse, extend, and modify the behavior of existing classes.
4.  **Polymorphism:** The ability of objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base type, enabling flexible and extensible code.

Let's break down each of these pillars with extensive C# code examples.

### 1. Encapsulation: Protecting Data and Behavior

**Concept:** Encapsulation is the practice of bundling data (fields) and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit (a class). It also involves restricting direct access to some of an object's components, meaning internal state is hidden from the outside world. This is primarily achieved through **access modifiers**.

**Benefits:**
* **Data Integrity:** Prevents unauthorized or invalid manipulation of an object's internal state.
* **Reduced Complexity:** Hides implementation details, making the object easier to use and reason about.
* **Maintainability:** Changes to internal implementation don't affect external code as long as the public interface remains consistent.

**Key C# Constructs:**
* **`class`:** The fundamental unit for encapsulation.
* **Access Modifiers:** `public`, `private`, `protected`, `internal`, `protected internal`, `private protected`.
* **Properties:** A special kind of member that provides controlled access to fields using `get` and `set` accessors.

**Code Example:**

```csharp
using System;

namespace OopConcepts
{
    public class BankAccount
    {
        // Private field: Encapsulated data. Cannot be accessed directly from outside the class.
        private decimal _balance;

        // Public Property: Provides controlled read/write access to the private _balance field.
        // Get accessor allows reading.
        // Set accessor allows writing, but here we add validation.
        public decimal Balance
        {
            get { return _balance; }
            private set // The 'set' accessor is private, meaning balance can only be set internally.
            {
                if (value < 0)
                {
                    throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException(nameof(value), "Balance cannot be negative.");
                }
                _balance = value;
            }
        }

        // Public Property (Auto-implemented): For simpler cases, compiler generates private field automatically.
        // This property allows reading (get) and internal setting (init in C# 9+ or private set).
        public string AccountNumber { get; init; } // init makes it immutable after construction

        // Constructor: The only way to initialize the balance directly when creating an object.
        public BankAccount(string accountNumber, decimal initialBalance)
        {
            if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(accountNumber))
            {
                throw new ArgumentException("Account number cannot be empty.", nameof(accountNumber));
            }
            if (initialBalance < 0)
            {
                throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException(nameof(initialBalance), "Initial balance cannot be negative.");
            }

            AccountNumber = accountNumber;
            _balance = initialBalance; // Direct assignment to private field in constructor is allowed
            Console.WriteLine($"Account {AccountNumber} created with balance {Balance:C}");
        }

        // Public Method: Defines the behavior for depositing money.
        // This is the controlled way to modify the _balance.
        public void Deposit(decimal amount)
        {
            if (amount <= 0)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Deposit amount must be positive.");
                return;
            }
            Balance += amount; // Using the Balance property's private set
            Console.WriteLine($"Deposited {amount:C}. New balance: {Balance:C}");
        }

        // Public Method: Defines the behavior for withdrawing money.
        public bool Withdraw(decimal amount)
        {
            if (amount <= 0)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Withdrawal amount must be positive.");
                return false;
            }
            if (amount > Balance)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Insufficient funds. Current balance: {Balance:C}. Attempted: {amount:C}");
                return false;
            }
            Balance -= amount; // Using the Balance property's private set
            Console.WriteLine($"Withdrew {amount:C}. New balance: {Balance:C}");
            return true;
        }
    }

    class EncapsulationDemo
    {
        public static void Run()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("\n--- Encapsulation Demo ---");
            BankAccount account = new BankAccount("12345", 1000m);

            // Accessing public properties (reading is allowed)
            Console.WriteLine($"Account Number: {account.AccountNumber}");
            Console.WriteLine($"Current Balance: {account.Balance:C}");

            // Modifying balance through public methods (controlled access)
            account.Deposit(500m);
            account.Withdraw(200m);
            account.Withdraw(1500m); // This will fail due to insufficient funds

            // The following lines would cause compile-time errors:
            // account._balance = 5000m; // Error: '_balance' is private
            // account.Balance = 5000m; // Error: 'Balance.set' is private
            // account.AccountNumber = "67890"; // Error: 'AccountNumber.init' is init-only

            Console.WriteLine($"Final Balance: {account.Balance:C}");
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation:** The `_balance` field is `private`, meaning it's hidden. We expose it via a `public` `Balance` property, but its `set` accessor is `private`. This design ensures that the balance can only be changed by the `Deposit` and `Withdraw` methods, which enforce business rules (e.g., positive amounts, sufficient funds). `AccountNumber` is `init`-only, meaning it's set once during construction and then immutable.

### 2. Abstraction: Focusing on What, Not How

**Concept:** Abstraction involves simplifying complex realities by modeling classes based on essential properties and behaviors. It means showing only relevant information to the user and hiding unnecessary details.

**Benefits:**
* **Simplifies Usage:** Users (other developers) interact with a simplified interface.
* **Reduces Impact of Change:** Internal implementation can change without affecting external code as long as the abstraction remains consistent.
* **Improved Design:** Promotes clear separation of concerns.

**Key C# Constructs:**
* **Abstract Classes:** Classes that cannot be instantiated directly and often contain `abstract` members (methods, properties) that derived classes *must* implement.
* **Interfaces:** Pure contracts that define a set of members without implementation (though C# 8.0+ allows default implementations).

**Code Example:**

```csharp
using System;

namespace OopConcepts
{
    // Abstract Class: Represents a generic 'Shape'
    // Cannot be instantiated directly. Serves as a base for specific shapes.
    public abstract class Shape
    {
        public string Name { get; set; }

        public Shape(string name)
        {
            Name = name;
        }

        // Abstract method: No implementation here.
        // Derived classes MUST implement this.
        public abstract double CalculateArea();

        // Non-abstract method: Can have an implementation and be inherited.
        public void DisplayDescription()
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"This is a {Name}. Its area is {CalculateArea():F2}.");
        }
    }

    // Concrete Class: Implements the abstract members of Shape
    public class Circle : Shape
    {
        public double Radius { get; set; }

        public Circle(string name, double radius) : base(name) // Call base constructor
        {
            Radius = radius;
        }

        // Override the abstract method from Shape
        public override double CalculateArea()
        {
            return Math.PI * Radius * Radius;
        }
    }

    // Concrete Class: Another implementation of Shape
    public class Rectangle : Shape
    {
        public double Width { get; set; }
        public double Height { get; set; }

        public Rectangle(string name, double width, double height) : base(name)
        {
            Width = width;
            Height = height;
        }

        // Override the abstract method from Shape
        public override double CalculateArea()
        {
            return Width * Height;
        }
    }

    // Interface: Defines a contract for objects that can be drawn
    public interface IDrawable
    {
        void Draw();
    }

    // Implementing the interface
    public class CanvasObject : IDisplayable, IDrawable // Reusing IDisplayable from previous example
    {
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public CanvasObject(string name) { Name = name; }

        public void Display() // Implementation from IDisplayable
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Displaying CanvasObject: {Name}");
        }

        public void Draw() // Implementation from IDrawable
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Drawing {Name} on canvas.");
        }
    }


    class AbstractionDemo
    {
        public static void Run()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("\n--- Abstraction Demo ---");

            // You cannot instantiate an abstract class directly:
            // Shape myShape = new Shape("Generic"); // Compile-time error

            // Create concrete instances of derived classes
            Shape circle = new Circle("Red Circle", 5.0);
            Shape rectangle = new Rectangle("Blue Rectangle", 4.0, 6.0);

            // Interact with them through the abstract base class 'Shape'
            // We don't care *how* they calculate area, just that they *can*.
            circle.DisplayDescription();    // Output: This is a Red Circle. Its area is 78.54.
            rectangle.DisplayDescription(); // Output: This is a Blue Rectangle. Its area is 24.00.

            // Using an interface
            IDrawable myCanvasItem = new CanvasObject("Tree Icon");
            myCanvasItem.Draw(); // Output: Drawing Tree Icon on canvas.
                                 // We don't need to know it's a CanvasObject, just that it can be drawn.
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation:** `Shape` is an abstract class with an abstract `CalculateArea()` method. `Circle` and `Rectangle` are concrete classes that *must* provide their own implementation of `CalculateArea()`. When we interact with them as `Shape` objects, we are using abstraction – we know they have a `CalculateArea()` method, but we don't know the specific geometric formula. `IDrawable` shows how interfaces define pure behavior.

### 3. Inheritance: Reusing and Extending

**Concept:** Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class (the **derived class** or **child class**) inherits properties, methods, and events from an existing class (the **base class** or **parent class**). This promotes code reuse and models an "is-a" relationship.

**Benefits:**
* **Code Reusability:** Avoids redundant code by sharing common functionality.
* **Extensibility:** Allows adding new features or modifying existing ones without altering the base class.
* **Hierarchical Classification:** Models real-world hierarchies (e.g., `Dog` is an `Animal`).

**Key C# Constructs:**
* **`:` (colon):** Used to specify the base class during class declaration.
* **`base` keyword:** Used to access members of the base class (e.g., calling a base constructor, accessing a base method).
* **`virtual` keyword:** In the base class, marks a method/property that can be overridden by derived classes.
* **`override` keyword:** In the derived class, indicates that a method/property is providing a new implementation for a `virtual` or `abstract` member from the base class.
* **`sealed` keyword:** Prevents a class from being inherited further or a method/property from being overridden further.

**Code Example:**

```csharp
using System;

namespace OopConcepts
{
    // Base Class: Animal
    public class Animal
    {
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public int Age { get; set; }

        public Animal(string name, int age)
        {
            Name = name;
            Age = age;
            Console.WriteLine($"{Name} (Animal) created.");
        }

        public void Eat()
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"{Name} is eating.");
        }

        // Virtual method: Can be overridden by derived classes
        public virtual void MakeSound()
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"{Name} makes a generic sound.");
        }

        // Finalizer (destructor): Rarely used in C#, but here for demonstration
        ~Animal()
        {
            // Console.WriteLine($"Finalizer for {Name} (Animal) called."); // Don't rely on this for resource cleanup
        }
    }

    // Derived Class: Dog inherits from Animal
    public class Dog : Animal
    {
        public string Breed { get; set; }

        // Constructor for Dog: Calls the base class constructor using 'base'
        public Dog(string name, int age, string breed) : base(name, age)
        {
            Breed = breed;
            Console.WriteLine($"{Name} (Dog) created. Breed: {Breed}");
        }

        // Override the virtual MakeSound method from Animal
        public override void MakeSound()
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"{Name} barks: Woof! Woof!");
        }

        // New method specific to Dog
        public void Fetch()
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"{Name} is fetching the ball.");
        }
    }

    // Another Derived Class: Cat inherits from Animal
    // This class could be sealed if no further derivation was intended.
    public class Cat : Animal
    {
        public bool HasClaws { get; set; }

        public Cat(string name, int age, bool hasClaws) : base(name, age)
        {
            HasClaws = hasClaws;
            Console.WriteLine($"{Name} (Cat) created. Has claws: {HasClaws}");
        }

        public override void MakeSound()
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"{Name} meows: Meow!");
        }

        public void Purr()
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"{Name} is purring.");
        }
    }

    class InheritanceDemo
    {
        public static void Run()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("\n--- Inheritance Demo ---");

            Animal genericAnimal = new Animal("Generic Pet", 2);
            genericAnimal.Eat();
            genericAnimal.MakeSound(); // Output: Generic Pet makes a generic sound.

            Console.WriteLine();

            Dog myDog = new Dog("Buddy", 5, "Golden Retriever");
            myDog.Eat();       // Inherited from Animal
            myDog.MakeSound(); // Overridden in Dog
            myDog.Fetch();     // Specific to Dog

            Console.WriteLine();

            Cat myCat = new Cat("Whiskers", 3, true);
            myCat.Eat();       // Inherited from Animal
            myCat.MakeSound(); // Overridden in Cat
            myCat.Purr();      // Specific to Cat
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation:** `Animal` is the base class. `Dog` and `Cat` are derived classes. They inherit `Name`, `Age`, and `Eat()` from `Animal`. They *override* the `MakeSound()` method to provide their specific sounds, demonstrating polymorphic behavior. They also add their own unique properties (`Breed`, `HasClaws`) and methods (`Fetch`, `Purr`).

---

### 4. Polymorphism: Many Forms

**Concept:** Polymorphism (from Greek, meaning "many forms") is the ability of an object to take on many forms. In OOP, it means that objects of different classes that are related through inheritance or interfaces can be treated as objects of a common type. This allows you to write generic code that can operate on different types of objects in a uniform way.

**Benefits:**
* **Flexibility and Extensibility:** New types can be added without modifying existing code that uses the common base type/interface.
* **Reduced Code Duplication:** Write a single piece of code that works with multiple types.
* **Simpler Code:** Less complex decision-making (`if-else` or `switch` statements) based on concrete types.

**Key C# Constructs:**
* **Method Overriding (`virtual`, `override`):** A derived class provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its base class.
* **Method Overloading:** Multiple methods in the *same* class (or derived class) with the same name but different parameter lists. This is a form of ad-hoc polymorphism.
* **Interfaces:** Objects implementing an interface can be treated as that interface type.
* **Abstract Classes:** Objects derived from an abstract class can be treated as the abstract base class.

**Code Example:**

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace OopConcepts
{
    // Reusing Animal, Dog, Cat from Inheritance Demo

    public class PolymorphismDemo
    {
        public static void Run()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("\n--- Polymorphism Demo ---");

            // Create a list of Animal objects
            // This list can hold any object that is an Animal (Animal, Dog, Cat)
            List<Animal> animals = new List<Animal>();
            animals.Add(new Animal("Leo", 6));
            animals.Add(new Dog("Max", 4, "Labrador"));
            animals.Add(new Cat("Luna", 2, false));
            animals.Add(new Dog("Daisy", 7, "Poodle"));

            Console.WriteLine("\nAnimals making sounds:");
            foreach (Animal animal in animals)
            {
                // Polymorphism in action:
                // The correct MakeSound() method (Animal, Dog, or Cat) is called at runtime
                animal.MakeSound();
            }

            Console.WriteLine("\n--- Interface Polymorphism (reusing IDisplayable) ---");
            // Assuming IDisplayable and CanvasObject are defined in AbstractionDemo
            List<IDisplayable> displayables = new List<IDisplayable>();
            displayables.Add(new Document("My Report", "Some text.")); // From Encapsulation Demo
            displayables.Add(new CanvasObject("Circle Shape")); // From Abstraction Demo

            foreach (IDisplayable item in displayables)
            {
                // Call Display() without knowing the concrete type
                item.Display();
            }

            Console.WriteLine("\n--- Method Overloading (simple example) ---");
            // Overloading is also a form of polymorphism (ad-hoc polymorphism)
            Calculator.Add(5, 3);
            Calculator.Add(5.5, 3.2);
            Calculator.Add("Hello", "World");
        }
    }

    // Helper class for Method Overloading demo
    public class Calculator
    {
        public static int Add(int a, int b)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Adding two ints: {a} + {b} = {a + b}");
            return a + b;
        }

        public static double Add(double a, double b)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Adding two doubles: {a} + {b} = {a + b}");
            return a + b;
        }

        public static string Add(string s1, string s2)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Concatenating two strings: \"{s1}\" + \"{s2}\" = \"{s1 + s2}\"");
            return s1 + s2;
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**
* The `List<Animal>` can hold objects of `Animal`, `Dog`, and `Cat`.
* When `animal.MakeSound()` is called inside the `foreach` loop, the correct `MakeSound()` implementation (from `Animal`, `Dog`, or `Cat`) is invoked based on the actual object's type at runtime. This is **runtime polymorphism** via method overriding.
* The `List<IDisplayable>` demonstrates **interface polymorphism**, where different unrelated types (a `Document` and a `CanvasObject`) can be treated uniformly because they both implement the `IDisplayable` contract.
* Method overloading in `Calculator` shows **compile-time polymorphism**, where the compiler chooses the correct `Add` method based on the types of arguments passed.

### Main Program to Run All Demos:

```csharp
using System;

namespace OopConcepts
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("--- C# Object-Oriented Techniques Overview ---");

            EncapsulationDemo.Run();
            AbstractionDemo.Run();
            InheritanceDemo.Run();
            PolymorphismDemo.Run();

```

### Conclusion:

Mastering these four pillars of OOP (Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism) is fundamental for any C# developer. They are not isolated concepts but work together to help you:

* **Model complex systems** in a clear and intuitive way.
* **Write reusable and maintainable code** that is easier to extend and debug.
* **Create flexible and loosely coupled architectures** that can adapt to changing requirements.

C# provides robust language features to fully support and encourage the application of these object-oriented principles, making it an excellent language for building robust and scalable software.
