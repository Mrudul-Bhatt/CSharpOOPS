### **Starting and Ending a Query Expression**

In LINQ, a query expression is defined by **starting with a `from` clause** and **ending with a `select` or `group`
clause**. These constructs provide the structure to define what data to query and how to shape or organize the output.

* * * * *

### **Starting a Query Expression**

1. **The `from` Clause**

    - A query expression **must begin with a `from` clause**, which specifies:
        - **The data source**: The collection or sequence you are querying.
        - **The range variable**: Represents each individual element in the source sequence.
    - The **range variable** is strongly typed based on the type of elements in the data source. This allows access to
      properties and methods of the type using the dot operator.

   **Example: Query Countries by Area**

   ```
   IEnumerable<Country> countryAreaQuery =
       from country in countries
       where country.Area > 500_000 // Filter for countries with area > 500,000 sq km
       select country; // End the query with select

   ```

   In this example:

    - `countries` is the data source.
    - `country` is the range variable, strongly typed as `Country`.
2. **Using Multiple `from` Clauses**

    - When a data source contains collections or sequences within its elements, use additional `from` clauses to
      traverse them.

   **Example: Query Cities in Each Country**

   ```
   IEnumerable<City> cityQuery =
       from country in countries
       from city in country.Cities // Traverse the Cities collection in each Country
       where city.Population > 10_000 // Filter for cities with population > 10,000
       select city; // Return the filtered cities

   ```

* * * * *

### **Ending a Query Expression**

A query must end with either:

1. **The `select` Clause**
2. **The `group` Clause**

### 1\. **`select` Clause**

- Used to produce a sequence of results.
- The `select` clause can:
    - Return the same type as the source data.
    - Transform the data (projection) into new types.

**Example: Sorting and Selecting Countries**

```
IEnumerable<Country> sortedQuery =
    from country in countries
    orderby country.Area // Sort countries by area
    select country; // Return sorted Country objects

```

**Example: Transforming Data with `select`**

```
var queryNameAndPop =
    from country in countries
    select new // Anonymous type
    {
        Name = country.Name,
        Pop = country.Population
    };

```

- The `select` clause creates a new object type with only the selected properties (`Name` and `Pop`).

**Note**: If a query produces an anonymous type, you must use `var` to declare the query variable.

### 2\. **`group` Clause**

- Used to group elements by a key.
- Produces a sequence of groups where each group is represented by an `IGrouping<TKey, TElement>`.

**Example: Grouping Countries by Name's First Letter**

```
var queryCountryGroups =
    from country in countries
    group country by country.Name[0]; // Group by the first letter of the country's name

```

Each group contains:

- A key (e.g., the first letter).
- The elements grouped under that key.

* * * * *

### **Continuations with `into`**

The `into` keyword allows you to:

- Store intermediate query results.
- Continue querying the grouped or selected data.

### Example: Grouping Countries by Population Ranges

```
var percentileQuery =
    from country in countries
    let percentile = (int)country.Population / 10_000_000 // Calculate population range
    group country by percentile into countryGroup // Create groups based on percentile
    where countryGroup.Key >= 20 // Filter groups where the key is 20 or more
    orderby countryGroup.Key // Sort groups by key
    select countryGroup;

```

**Explanation:**

1. The `let` keyword introduces a new variable (`percentile`).
2. The `group ... by` clause creates groups using the `percentile` value as the key.
3. The `into` keyword allows additional filtering (`where`) and sorting (`orderby`) on the groups.

**Output Example:**

```
Key: 20
China: 1,400,000,000
India: 1,300,000,000

```

### **Key Takeaways**

- **`from` Clause**:
    - Always the starting point of a query.
    - Defines the data source and range variable.
- **Ending Clauses**:
    - **`select`**: Produces results, with or without transformation.
    - **`group`**: Groups elements by a key, producing `IGrouping<TKey, TElement>`.
- **`into` Keyword**:
    - Enables further operations after grouping or selection.
    - Useful for refining results or chaining operations.
