C# provides three convenient type features: **implicit types**, **anonymous types**, and **nullable value types**.
Here's what they are and how to use them:

### **1\. Implicitly Typed Local Variables (`var`)**

- **What it is**:\
  You can declare a local variable using the `var` keyword without explicitly specifying the type. The compiler infers
  the type based on the value you assign.
- **Key Points**:
    - The variable must be initialized at the time of declaration.
    - The inferred type is **fixed at compile-time**, not runtime.
    - `var` cannot be used for class members or method parameters.

### **2\. Anonymous Types**

- **What it is**:\
  Anonymous types allow you to create lightweight types on the fly without explicitly defining a class. These are useful
  for temporarily grouping a few related values.

- **Key Points**:

- Anonymous types are immutable (their properties are read-only).
- Typically used with LINQ queries to shape data results.
- The type name is generated by the compiler and is inaccessible.

### **3\. Nullable Value Types (`T?`)**

- **What it is**:\
  A nullable value type is a value type (e.g., `int`, `bool`) that can also hold a `null` value. These are instances of
  `System.Nullable<T>`.

- **Why it's useful**:\
  Nullable types are especially helpful when working with databases where columns can have `NULL` values, or for
  scenarios where a value might be "not set."

- **Key Points**:

- Declared using `T?` syntax, e.g., `int?` or `bool?`.
- Use the `.HasValue` property to check if the value is set, and `.Value` to retrieve it.
- The null-coalescing operator (`??`) provides a default value if the variable is null.

### **Key Takeaways**

- **Implicit Types** (`var`): Simplify variable declarations while ensuring type safety.
- **Anonymous Types**: Provide a quick way to group related data without defining a formal class.
- **Nullable Value Types** (`T?`): Allow value types to hold a `null` value, making them versatile for scenarios like
  database interaction.
