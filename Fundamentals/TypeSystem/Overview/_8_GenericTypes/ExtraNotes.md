The declaration `public class DataProcessor<T> where T : IComparable<T>` defines a **generic class** with a **type
constraint**. Let's break it down:

### **Components Explained**

1. **`public class DataProcessor<T>`**:

    - This defines a **generic class** `DataProcessor` with a **type parameter** `T`.
    - The `T` acts as a placeholder for a type that will be specified when the class is used.
2. **`where T : IComparable<T>`**:

    - This is a **type constraint** that restricts the types that can be used as `T`.
    - The constraint specifies that the type `T` must implement the `IComparable<T>` interface.

### **What is `IComparable<T>`?**

- `IComparable<T>` is an interface in .NET used to define a standard way to compare two objects of the same type.
- Classes or structs that implement `IComparable<T>` must define the `CompareTo` method, which returns:
    - **`0`** if the two objects are equal.
    - **`> 0`** if the current object is greater than the other object.
    - **`< 0`** if the current object is less than the other object.

### **Why Use the Constraint?**

The constraint ensures that the `DataProcessor` class can use the `CompareTo` method provided by `IComparable<T>`.
Without this constraint, the compiler wouldn't allow you to call `CompareTo` on `T` because it wouldn't know if `T`
supports it.
