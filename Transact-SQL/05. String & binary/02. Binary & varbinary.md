Certainly! Here's a **point-by-point explanation** of the article **"binary and varbinary (Transact-SQL)"** from Microsoft Docs for SQL Server. These data types are used to store binary data, such as images, files, or any non-textual data.

## üß± 1. **What are `binary` and `varbinary`?**

* **`binary(n)`**: A fixed-length binary data type. It stores exactly *n* bytes of data, padding with zeros if necessary.
* **`varbinary(n)`**: A variable-length binary data type. It stores up to *n* bytes of data, using only the space needed.
* **`varbinary(max)`**: A special form of `varbinary` that can store up to 2^31-1 bytes (approximately 2 GB) of binary data.

## üì¶ 2. **Storage and Length**

| Data Type        | Description                 | Max Length         |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `binary(n)`      | Fixed-length binary data    | 1 to 8,000 bytes   |
| `varbinary(n)`   | Variable-length binary data | 1 to 8,000 bytes   |
| `varbinary(max)` | Variable-length binary data | Up to 2^31-1 bytes |

* For `binary(n)`, if the data inserted is shorter than *n* bytes, SQL Server pads it with zeros.
* For `varbinary(n)`, SQL Server stores only the actual data length, saving space.

## üõ†Ô∏è 3. **Usage Examples**

### Declaring Variables:

```sql
DECLARE @FixedBinary binary(10);
DECLARE @VarBinary varbinary(10);
DECLARE @LargeBinary varbinary(max);
```

### Inserting Data:

```sql
-- Fixed-length binary
INSERT INTO BinaryDataTable (DataColumn)
VALUES (CAST('ABC' AS binary(10))); -- Pads with zeros to make 10 bytes

-- Variable-length binary
INSERT INTO BinaryDataTable (DataColumn)
VALUES (CAST('ABC' AS varbinary(10))); -- Stores only 3 bytes
```

---

## üìÅ 4. **Common Use Cases**

* **`binary(n)`**: When you need to store binary data of a consistent size, such as cryptographic hashes (e.g., SHA-256 hashes).
* **`varbinary(n)`**: When storing binary data that varies in size but is relatively small, like small images or files.
* **`varbinary(max)`**: For large binary data, such as documents, audio files, or images exceeding 8,000 bytes.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è 5. **Deprecated Types**

* The `image` data type was previously used for large binary data but is now deprecated.
* Microsoft recommends using `varbinary(max)` instead of `image` for new development.

---

## üîÑ 6. **Conversions and Functions**

* You can convert data to `binary` or `varbinary` using the `CAST` or `CONVERT` functions.

```sql
SELECT CAST('SampleData' AS varbinary(20));
```

* Functions like `DATALENGTH` can be used to determine the number of bytes used by a binary data field.

```sql
SELECT DATALENGTH(DataColumn) FROM BinaryDataTable;
```

---

## üìå 7. **Best Practices**

* Use `varbinary(n)` when you expect varying sizes of binary data up to 8,000 bytes.
* Use `varbinary(max)` for binary data that might exceed 8,000 bytes.
* Avoid using `binary(n)` unless you have a specific need for fixed-length binary storage.
* Always consider the size of the data and storage implications when choosing between `binary` and `varbinary`.
