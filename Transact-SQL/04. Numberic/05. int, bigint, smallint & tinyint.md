Here’s a **point-by-point explanation** of the article **“int, bigint, smallint, and tinyint (Transact-SQL)”** from Microsoft Docs for SQL Server — these are the integer types in SQL Server.

---

### 🌿 1. **What are `int`, `bigint`, `smallint`, and `tinyint`?**

* These are **exact numeric integer data types**.
* They store **whole numbers** (no decimal or fractional part).
* They differ mainly in **storage size** and **range of values**.

---

### ⚙️ 2. **Type definitions and ranges**

| Data type | Storage size | Range                                                   |
| --------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| tinyint   | 1 byte       | 0 to 255                                                |
| smallint  | 2 bytes      | −32,768 to 32,767                                       |
| int       | 4 bytes      | −2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647                         |
| bigint    | 8 bytes      | −9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 |

---

### 📦 3. **When to use each type**

* **tinyint** → small counters, flags, or values between 0–255.
* **smallint** → small ranges like age, quantity, or year difference.
* **int** → most common general-purpose integer type.
* **bigint** → very large numbers, such as identity keys for large tables, scientific data, or financial ledgers.

---

### 📊 4. **Default behavior**

* If you declare a column or variable as `int` without specifying anything:

```sql
DECLARE @counter int;
```

* SQL Server assigns it as a **4-byte signed integer**.

---

### 🌲 5. **Example table definition**

```sql
CREATE TABLE Products (
    ProductID int PRIMARY KEY,
    Quantity smallint,
    Status tinyint
);
```

---

### ⚡ 6. **Example usage in variables**

```sql
DECLARE @largeID bigint = 9223372036854775807;
DECLARE @age smallint = 25;
DECLARE @flag tinyint = 1;
```

---

### 🚦 7. **Special notes**

* **tinyint** does not allow negative values.
* **int** is the most commonly used and generally the default integer type.
* You can **explicitly cast or convert** between integer types, but be careful to avoid overflow.

---

### 💥 8. **Overflow behavior**

* If you insert a value outside the type’s range, you get an error:

```sql
DECLARE @val tinyint = 300; -- Error: out of range
```

---

### 📌 9. **Identity and auto-increment**

* These integer types are often used for **identity columns**:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Customers (
    CustomerID int IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY
);
```

---

### ✅ Best practices

* Choose the **smallest type** that covers your needed range to optimize storage.
* For large-scale systems, prefer `bigint` for IDs when you expect over \~2 billion rows.
* Use `tinyint` for flags or enums where no negative values are needed.

---

### 🔧 Quick example

```sql
-- Declare variables
DECLARE @itemCount int = 1000;
DECLARE @status tinyint = 1;

-- Insert into table
INSERT INTO Orders (OrderID, Quantity)
VALUES (1, 500);
```

### 🔍 Summary table

| Type     | Range                            | Size    | Notes                        |
| -------- | -------------------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------- |
| tinyint  | 0 to 255                         | 1 byte  | No negative values           |
| smallint | −32,768 to 32,767                | 2 bytes | Small numeric ranges         |
| int      | −2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647  | 4 bytes | General-purpose, most common |
| bigint   | −9 quintillion to +9 quintillion | 8 bytes | Large-scale data, large IDs  |

If you like, I can also:
✅ Provide **example queries comparing these types**,
✅ Explain **when to switch from int to bigint in a growing database**, or
✅ Write a **cheat sheet comparing all numeric types (including decimal, float, bit)**.
