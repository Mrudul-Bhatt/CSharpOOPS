Here’s a **point-by-point explanation** of the article **“bit (Transact-SQL)”** from Microsoft Docs for SQL Server — this explains the `bit` data type.

---

### 🌿 1. **What is `bit`?**

* `bit` is a **numeric data type** in SQL Server.
* It stores **integer values 1, 0, or NULL**, which makes it useful for representing **Boolean (true/false) or flag values**.

---

### ⚙️ 2. **Storage details**

* A single `bit` column stores **1 bit** (smallest possible storage).
* If you have **1–8 bit columns** in a table, they are stored together in **1 byte**.
* If you have **9–16 bit columns**, they are stored together in **2 bytes**, and so on.

---

### 📦 3. **Valid values**

* **0** → treated as false.
* **1** → treated as true.
* **NULL** → unknown / no value.

---

### 📊 4. **Implicit conversions**

* You can assign integer values:

  * Any **nonzero value** is converted to **1**.
  * **Zero (0)** remains **0**.

Example:

```sql
DECLARE @b bit;
SET @b = 5; -- stored as 1
SET @b = 0; -- stored as 0
```

---

### 🌲 5. **Example table definition**

```sql
CREATE TABLE Users (
    UserID int PRIMARY KEY,
    IsActive bit NOT NULL
);
```

---

### ⚡ 6. **Example usage in queries**

```sql
INSERT INTO Users VALUES (1, 1);
INSERT INTO Users VALUES (2, 0);
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE IsActive = 1;
```

---

### 🚦 7. **Behavior in expressions**

* You can use `bit` in conditions:

```sql
IF EXISTS (SELECT * FROM Users WHERE IsActive = 1)
    PRINT 'Active users found';
```

* You can also combine it in `CASE` expressions or logical conditions.

---

### 📌 Special notes

* You **cannot perform arithmetic operations** (like addition) on `bit` values.
* `bit` is automatically **converted to 0 or 1** in queries, even if you pass other numbers.
* **Default value:** If no value is set and the column allows NULLs, it defaults to `NULL`.

---

### ✅ Best practices

* Use `bit` for **flags or on/off indicators**, such as:

  * IsDeleted
  * IsActive
  * HasPaid
* Avoid using `tinyint` or `char(1)` when you only need a true/false value.
* Always **explicitly handle NULL values** if your logic depends on them.

### 🔧 Quick example

```sql
-- Declare and use a bit variable
DECLARE @isApproved bit;
SET @isApproved = 1;
IF @isApproved = 1
    PRINT 'Approved!';
```

---

### Summary table

| Value assigned        | Stored as (bit) |
| --------------------- | --------------- |
| 0                     | 0               |
| Nonzero (e.g., 5, -3) | 1               |
| NULL                  | NULL            |

If you like, I can also:
✅ Show **example queries using `bit` in filtering**,
✅ Help write **migration scripts converting flags to `bit`**, or
✅ Provide **a practice exercise**.
