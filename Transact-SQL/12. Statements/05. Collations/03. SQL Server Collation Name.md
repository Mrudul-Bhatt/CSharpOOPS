In SQL Server, a **Collation Name** is a specific string that encapsulates a set of rules for how character data is sorted, compared, and how its sensitivity to case, accents, Kana characters, and character width is handled. Understanding these names is fundamental for anyone working with character data in SQL Server, especially in multilingual environments.

### Understanding the Structure of a SQL Server Collation Name

SQL Server collation names typically follow a structured convention that provides a concise summary of their properties. While slight variations exist, a common format for **Windows collations** (the recommended type for new development) is:

`Language_SortingRules_Version_CaseSensitivity_AccentSensitivity_KanaSensitivity_WidthSensitivity_SupplementaryCharacters_UTF8`

Let's break down each component:

1.  **Language / Alphabet (`Language_SortingRules`):**
    * This is the initial part of the name and defines the primary language or linguistic group whose sorting rules are applied.
    * **Examples:**
        * `Latin1_General`: Most common for Western European languages (English, Spanish, French, German, etc.). It uses code page 1252.
        * `Japanese`: For Japanese characters and their specific sorting rules.
        * `Chinese_PRC`: For Simplified Chinese used in the People's Republic of China.
        * `Arabic`: For Arabic script.
        * `Cyrillic_General`: For Cyrillic script.
        * `German_PhoneBook`: A specific German sorting rule that treats "ä" as "ae", "ö" as "oe", "ü" as "ue", and "ß" as "ss".

2.  **Version (`_Version` - optional for older collations, explicit for newer):**
    * Many collations include a version number (e.g., `_100`, `_140`). This indicates the version of the underlying Unicode Collation Algorithm (UCA) or Windows collation rules that the collation is based on. Newer versions often have improved or more comprehensive linguistic rules.
    * Collations without a version number (e.g., `Latin1_General_CI_AS`) are typically older, often version 80 (SQL Server 2000 era). `_100` was introduced in SQL Server 2008, `_140` in SQL Server 2017.

3.  **Case Sensitivity (`_CI` or `_CS`):**
    * This suffix determines how SQL Server treats uppercase and lowercase letters during comparisons.
    * `_CI`: **Case-Insensitive**. 'A' is considered equal to 'a'. This is very common for general-purpose searches.
    * `_CS`: **Case-Sensitive**. 'A' is *not* considered equal to 'a'. Important for strict matching, e.g., unique identifiers or passwords.

4.  **Accent Sensitivity (`_AI` or `_AS`):**
    * This suffix defines how accented characters are treated.
    * `_AI`: **Accent-Insensitive**. 'e' is considered equal to 'é' (and 'è', 'ê', etc.). Useful for broad searches where accents might be ignored.
    * `_AS`: **Accent-Sensitive**. 'e' is *not* considered equal to 'é'. Important for precise linguistic matching.

5.  **Kana Sensitivity (`_KS` - primarily for Japanese):**
    * `_KS`: **Kana-Sensitive**. Distinguishes between Japanese Hiragana and Katakana characters.
    * If omitted, it's Kana-Insensitive (`_KI`).

6.  **Width Sensitivity (`_WS` - primarily for East Asian languages):**
    * `_WS`: **Width-Sensitive**. Distinguishes between full-width (double-byte) and half-width (single-byte) characters.
    * If omitted, it's Width-Insensitive (`_WI`).

7.  **Supplementary Characters (`_SC` - since SQL Server 2012):**
    * `_SC`: **Supplementary Characters sensitive**. This option allows Unicode collations to correctly handle "supplementary characters" (Unicode code points above U+FFFF) when using `NCHAR` and `NVARCHAR` data types. These characters are represented by "surrogate pairs" in UTF-16 encoding. If you deal with a wide range of Unicode characters (e.g., less common ideograms, emojis), `_SC` is crucial for correct sorting and comparison.

8.  **UTF-8 Encoding (`_UTF8` - since SQL Server 2019):**
    * `_UTF8`: Indicates that the collation uses UTF-8 encoding for `CHAR` and `VARCHAR` data types. This is a significant feature in modern SQL Server versions, allowing `VARCHAR` to store a broader range of Unicode characters efficiently without the need for `NVARCHAR`.

#### Special Collation Types:

* **Binary Collations (`_BIN` or `_BIN2`):**
    * These collations don't follow linguistic rules. Instead, they sort and compare characters based on their underlying byte values (`_BIN`) or Unicode code points (`_BIN2`).
    * `_BIN`: Older binary sort. For Unicode data, it performed a byte-by-byte comparison after the first character was compared by code point.
    * `_BIN2`: **Preferred binary sort**. Compares all characters purely by their Unicode code points. This is the fastest and most exact comparison method as it bypasses linguistic rules. When using `_BIN2`, all other sensitivity flags (CI, AS, KS, WS) are implicitly true (i.e., case-sensitive, accent-sensitive, etc.) because it's a raw code-point comparison.

* **SQL Server Collations (`SQL_` prefix):**
    * Collations that start with `SQL_` (e.g., `SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS`). These are older collations developed before SQL Server fully adopted Windows collations.
    * They are primarily for backward compatibility and **should generally be avoided for new development** due to potential inconsistencies (e.g., sorting differences between `VARCHAR` and `NVARCHAR` for the same values) and less accurate linguistic sorting compared to modern Windows collations.
    * `CP1` in `SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS` refers to code page 1252.

### Common and Important SQL Server Collation Types

Here are some collations you'll frequently encounter and their significance:

1.  **`Latin1_General_CI_AS`**
    * **Meaning:** Western European (code page 1252), Case-Insensitive, Accent-Sensitive.
    * **Usage:** This is a very common default for many SQL Server installations, particularly in English-speaking environments. It's generally good for most business applications where you want "John" and "john" to be treated the same, but "resumé" and "resume" to be distinct.

2.  **`Latin1_General_CI_AI`**
    * **Meaning:** Western European, Case-Insensitive, Accent-Insensitive.
    * **Usage:** Ideal for search functionality where users might not use correct casing or accents (e.g., searching for "resume" should find "résumé").

3.  **`Latin1_General_CS_AS`**
    * **Meaning:** Western European, Case-Sensitive, Accent-Sensitive.
    * **Usage:** Required for scenarios where exact string matching, including case, is critical (e.g., unique product keys, identifiers where "ABC" is different from "abc").

4.  **`Latin1_General_BIN2`**
    * **Meaning:** Western European, Binary Code-Point Sort.
    * **Usage:**
        * **Performance:** Fastest comparison method.
        * **Exactness:** Guarantees comparisons based purely on the underlying Unicode code points. This is implicitly case-sensitive, accent-sensitive, etc.
        * **Hash Keys/Unique Identifiers:** Excellent for creating computed columns for hashing or unique key lookups where linguistic ordering isn't a concern.

5.  **`Japanese_CI_AS` (or similar for other languages like `Chinese_PRC_CI_AS`)**
    * **Meaning:** Specific to Japanese (or Chinese), Case-Insensitive, Accent-Sensitive.
    * **Usage:** When dealing with data in specific languages, using their dedicated collations ensures correct linguistic sorting and comparison behavior. These often have additional sensitivities like Kana or Width.

6.  **`Latin1_General_100_CI_AS_SC`**
    * **Meaning:** Western European, Version 100 rules, Case-Insensitive, Accent-Sensitive, Supplementary Characters Sensitive.
    * **Usage:** A modern, recommended collation for `NVARCHAR` data if you need to support a broad range of Unicode characters, including emojis and less common scripts.

7.  **`Latin1_General_100_CI_AS_SC_UTF8`**
    * **Meaning:** Same as above, but also uses UTF-8 encoding for `VARCHAR` data.
    * **Usage:** In SQL Server 2019+, this is highly recommended for `VARCHAR` columns if you need to store and manipulate Unicode data efficiently and minimize storage space compared to `NVARCHAR` for many scenarios.

### How to Check and Use Collation Names (Code Examples)

#### 1. Listing All Available Collations

You can query the `sys.fn_helpcollations()` system function to see every collation supported by your SQL Server instance.

```sql
SELECT name, description
FROM sys.fn_helpcollations()
ORDER BY name;
GO
```

This query will return a long list of collations, each with a detailed description, which helps in understanding their properties.

#### 2. Checking Server, Database, and Column Collations

```sql
USE master;
GO

-- Check Server Collation
SELECT SERVERPROPERTY('Collation') AS ServerCollation;
GO

-- Check Database Collation (replace 'YourDatabaseName' with an actual database)
SELECT DATABASEPROPERTYEX('CollationDemoDB', 'Collation') AS DatabaseCollation;
GO

USE CollationDemoDB; -- Switch to our demo database

-- Check Column Collation for the 'Users' table
SELECT
    OBJECT_NAME(object_id) AS TableName,
    name AS ColumnName,
    collation_name AS ColumnCollation
FROM sys.columns
WHERE OBJECT_ID = OBJECT_ID('Users') AND name = 'UserName';
GO

-- Check Column Collation for the 'Products' table
SELECT
    OBJECT_NAME(object_id) AS TableName,
    name AS ColumnName,
    collation_name AS ColumnCollation
FROM sys.columns
WHERE OBJECT_ID = OBJECT_ID('Products') AND name IN ('ProductName', 'ProductCode');
GO
```

#### 3. Setting Collations at Different Levels

As discussed in the `COLLATE` clause explanation, collation names are used with the `COLLATE` clause.

**Example 3.1: Setting Database Collation (during creation or alteration)**

```sql
USE master;
GO

IF DB_ID('MyInternationalDB') IS NOT NULL DROP DATABASE MyInternationalDB;
CREATE DATABASE MyInternationalDB
COLLATE Latin1_General_100_CI_AS_SC_UTF8; -- Modern, SC, UTF8 enabled
GO

USE MyInternationalDB;
GO
SELECT DATABASEPROPERTYEX('MyInternationalDB', 'Collation') AS MyDatabaseCollation;
GO
```

**Example 3.2: Setting Column Collation (during `CREATE TABLE`)**

```sql
USE CollationDemoDB;
GO

CREATE TABLE CustomerData (
    CustomerID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FullName NVARCHAR(200) COLLATE French_CI_AS, -- French-specific sorting rules
    PassportNumber VARCHAR(50) COLLATE Latin1_General_CS_AS -- Case-sensitive for passport numbers
);
GO
```

**Example 3.3: Using Collation Name in an Expression (e.g., `ORDER BY`)**

```sql
USE CollationDemoDB;
GO

-- Assume Products.ProductName is Latin1_General_CS_AS (Case-Sensitive, Accent-Sensitive)
-- Let's see how 'widget', 'Widget', 'WIDGET' sort by default
SELECT ProductID, ProductName FROM Products ORDER BY ProductName;
-- Expected: 'WIDGET', 'Widget', 'widget' (due to CS_AS and default sorting rules)

-- Now, force a case-insensitive, accent-insensitive sort
SELECT ProductID, ProductName FROM Products ORDER BY ProductName COLLATE Latin1_General_CI_AI;
-- Expected: 'widget', 'Widget', 'WIDGET' (all treated as same, sorted by internal tie-breaker or order of insertion)

-- Let's test the German_PhoneBook_CI_AS again for 'Müller', 'Mueller', 'Muller'
SELECT OrderID, CustomerName FROM Orders ORDER BY CustomerName;
-- Expected: Müller, Mueller, Muller (German Phone Book rule, 'ü' after 'u' before 'ue')

SELECT OrderID, CustomerName FROM Orders ORDER BY CustomerName COLLATE Latin1_General_CI_AS;
-- Expected: Mueller, Muller, Müller (standard Latin1 sort, 'u' before 'ü')
GO
```

Understanding SQL Server Collation Names is fundamental for correct data handling, especially when dealing with diverse linguistic requirements or ensuring specific string comparison behaviors within your database. Always choose the most appropriate collation based on the data you expect to store and the operations you need to perform.
