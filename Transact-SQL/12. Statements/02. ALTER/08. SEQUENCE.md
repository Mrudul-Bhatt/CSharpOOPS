Let's explore the `ALTER SEQUENCE` statement in Transact-SQL. Sequences are a useful feature in SQL Server (introduced in SQL Server 2012) that generate a series of numbers in a specified order, with a defined increment. They are often used for generating unique IDs, similar to `IDENTITY` columns, but offer more flexibility.

### Understanding Sequences

* **Independent Objects:** Unlike `IDENTITY` columns which are tied to a specific table, sequences are standalone database objects.
* **Flexible Number Generation:** You can define the start value, increment, minimum/maximum values, and whether it cycles.
* **Multiple Tables:** A single sequence object can be used by multiple tables, allowing for consistent ID generation across different entities.
* **Caching:** Sequences can cache a block of numbers in memory for faster generation, reducing disk I/O.
* **Batch Allocation:** You can get the next number in a sequence without inserting a row, useful for pre-allocating IDs.

### `ALTER SEQUENCE` Statement

The `ALTER SEQUENCE` statement allows you to modify the properties of an existing sequence object.

**Syntax:**

```sql
ALTER SEQUENCE [ schema_name . ] sequence_name
    [ { START WITH <constant> } |
      { INCREMENT BY <constant> } |
      { MINVALUE <constant> } |
      { MAXVALUE <constant> } |
      { CYCLE | NO CYCLE } |
      { CACHE <constant> | NO CACHE } |
      { OWNED BY { database_principal_name | SCHEMA } } ] [ ,...n ]
[ ; ]
```

**Key Arguments:**

* `sequence_name`: The name of the sequence to be altered.
* `START WITH <constant>`: Changes the *next* starting value for the sequence. This is typically used in conjunction with `RESTART WITH`. **Important:** If `START WITH` is changed, the sequence generates values starting from this new value only when `RESTART WITH` is explicitly used, or when the sequence exhausts its current cached values and needs to re-seed.
* `INCREMENT BY <constant>`: Changes the value by which the sequence number is incremented (or decremented if negative) for each call to `NEXT VALUE FOR`.
* `MINVALUE <constant>`: Changes the minimum value the sequence can generate.
* `MAXVALUE <constant>`: Changes the maximum value the sequence can generate.
* `CYCLE | NO CYCLE`:
    * `CYCLE`: Specifies that the sequence should restart from `MINVALUE` (for ascending sequences) or `MAXVALUE` (for descending sequences) after reaching its maximum or minimum value.
    * `NO CYCLE`: (Default) Specifies that the sequence should stop generating values after reaching its maximum or minimum value, and subsequent calls to `NEXT VALUE FOR` will produce an error.
* `CACHE <constant> | NO CACHE`:
    * `CACHE <constant>`: Specifies how many sequence values SQL Server pre-allocates and keeps in memory. This improves performance for high-volume insertions but can lead to "gaps" in sequence numbers if the server restarts or if values in the cache are not used.
    * `NO CACHE`: Values are generated one at a time, ensuring no gaps, but potentially at a performance cost for very high-volume scenarios.
* `OWNED BY { database_principal_name | SCHEMA }`: Changes the owner of the sequence object.

### Code Examples

Let's set up a scenario with a sequence and then demonstrate various `ALTER SEQUENCE` operations.

```sql
-- 1. Create a sample database
CREATE DATABASE SequenceDemoDB;
GO

USE SequenceDemoDB;
GO

-- 2. Create a basic sequence
CREATE SEQUENCE OrderNumberSequence
    START WITH 1000
    INCREMENT BY 1
    MINVALUE 1000
    NO CYCLE
    CACHE 100; -- Cache 100 numbers for performance
GO

-- 3. Create a table that uses the sequence for its ID
CREATE TABLE SalesOrders (
    OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT NEXT VALUE FOR OrderNumberSequence,
    OrderDate DATE DEFAULT GETDATE(),
    CustomerName VARCHAR(100)
);

-- 4. Insert some data to use the sequence
INSERT INTO SalesOrders (CustomerName) VALUES ('Alice Smith');
INSERT INTO SalesOrders (CustomerName) VALUES ('Bob Johnson');
INSERT INTO SalesOrders (CustomerName) VALUES ('Charlie Brown');

SELECT * FROM SalesOrders;
SELECT NEXT VALUE FOR OrderNumberSequence AS NextAvailableOrderID; -- See next value in sequence
```

---

**Example 1: Change Increment Value**

We want the next order numbers to increment by 5 instead of 1.

```sql
-- Alter the sequence to increment by 5
ALTER SEQUENCE OrderNumberSequence
INCREMENT BY 5;
GO

-- Insert new data to see the effect
INSERT INTO SalesOrders (CustomerName) VALUES ('David Lee');
INSERT INTO SalesOrders (CustomerName) VALUES ('Eva Green');

SELECT * FROM SalesOrders;
SELECT NEXT VALUE FOR OrderNumberSequence AS NextAvailableOrderID;
```

---

**Example 2: Change MaxValue and Set to CYCLE**

We want the sequence to reset after reaching a certain maximum value.

```sql
-- Alter the sequence to have a smaller MAXVALUE and CYCLE
ALTER SEQUENCE OrderNumberSequence
MAXVALUE 1030
CYCLE;
GO

-- Insert data until it cycles (might need more inserts depending on current value and cache)
-- Note: The exact value it cycles from depends on the current sequence value and cache.
-- For demonstration, let's artificially set the current value to close to MAXVALUE first.
-- This requires a restart, so we'll use RESTART WITH in the next example.

-- For now, just observe the new MAXVALUE and CYCLE property
SELECT
    name,
    start_value,
    increment,
    minimum_value,
    maximum_value,
    is_cycling,
    cache_size,
    current_value -- Note: current_value might not be exact for cached sequences
FROM sys.sequences
WHERE name = 'OrderNumberSequence';
```

---

**Example 3: Restart a Sequence (`RESTART WITH`)**

This is crucial for resetting the sequence to a new starting point. The current value of the sequence is set to the `START WITH` value (or `MINVALUE` if `START WITH` isn't specified).

```sql
-- Restart the sequence from a new starting point
ALTER SEQUENCE OrderNumberSequence
RESTART WITH 2000; -- The next value generated will be 2000

-- Insert new data to see the effect
INSERT INTO SalesOrders (CustomerName) VALUES ('Frank White');
INSERT INTO SalesOrders (CustomerName) VALUES ('Grace Hall');

SELECT * FROM SalesOrders;
SELECT NEXT VALUE FOR OrderNumberSequence AS NextAvailableOrderID;
```

---

**Example 4: Change Caching Behavior (`NO CACHE`)**

If you want to ensure no gaps in your sequence numbers (e.g., for auditing or compliance), you can disable caching. This will generally impact performance for high-volume operations.

```sql
-- Alter the sequence to NO CACHE
ALTER SEQUENCE OrderNumberSequence
NO CACHE;
GO

-- Verify caching status
SELECT
    name,
    cache_size
FROM sys.sequences
WHERE name = 'OrderNumberSequence';

-- Insert data - observe that NEXT VALUE FOR calls will likely be slower
INSERT INTO SalesOrders (CustomerName) VALUES ('Hannah Green');
SELECT * FROM SalesOrders;
SELECT NEXT VALUE FOR OrderNumberSequence AS NextAvailableOrderID;
```

---

**Example 5: Change Owner (`OWNED BY`)**

You can change the database principal who owns the sequence. This affects permissions.

```sql
-- Create a new user (or use an existing one)
CREATE USER AppAdmin WITHOUT LOGIN;
GO

-- Change the owner of the sequence to AppAdmin
ALTER SEQUENCE OrderNumberSequence
OWNED BY AppAdmin;
GO

-- Verify the new owner
SELECT
    s.name AS SequenceName,
    p.name AS OwnerName
FROM sys.sequences AS s
JOIN sys.database_principals AS p ON s.principal_id = p.principal_id
WHERE s.name = 'OrderNumberSequence';
```

### Important Considerations for Interviews:

* **Flexibility vs. Simplicity:** Be able to articulate why you'd use a sequence over an `IDENTITY` column (e.g., shared ID generation across tables, pre-allocation of IDs, custom increments, cycling).
* **Performance (`CACHE`):** Explain the trade-off between performance (with `CACHE`) and ensuring gapless sequences (`NO CACHE`). Discuss the potential for gaps with caching during server restarts.
* **Gapless Sequences:** If an interviewer asks for a "guaranteed gapless" sequence, explain that `NO CACHE` is the way to go, but acknowledge the potential performance impact. For truly critical gapless scenarios, application-level logic or specific locking might be required beyond just `NO CACHE`.
* **`RESTART WITH`:** Highlight the importance of `RESTART WITH` for resetting sequence values, especially in testing or recovery scenarios.
* **Concurrency:** Discuss how sequences handle concurrency and ensure unique numbers even with many simultaneous requests.
* **Monitoring:** Briefly mention how to check sequence properties using `sys.sequences` and `NEXT VALUE FOR` to see the next available number.

`ALTER SEQUENCE` is a powerful tool for managing numerical sequences in SQL Server, providing granular control over their behavior.

### Cleanup:

```sql
USE master;
GO

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS SequenceDemoDB.dbo.SalesOrders; -- Drop table first
DROP SEQUENCE IF EXISTS SequenceDemoDB.dbo.OrderNumberSequence; -- Then sequence
DROP USER IF EXISTS SequenceDemoDB.dbo.AppAdmin;
GO

DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS SequenceDemoDB;
GO
```
