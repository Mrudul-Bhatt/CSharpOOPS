`ALTER INDEX` is a crucial Transact-SQL statement for managing and maintaining indexes in SQL Server. Indexes are fundamental for query performance, and over time, they can become fragmented or require adjustments. This statement allows you to rebuild, reorganize, disable, or set options for existing indexes.

Let's explore the most important `ALTER INDEX` operations in detail with code examples.

### 1. Understanding Index Fragmentation

Before diving into `ALTER INDEX`, it's important to understand *why* you'd use it. Indexes can become fragmented due to repeated `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operations. Fragmentation means the logical order of index pages doesn't match their physical order on disk, leading to more I/O operations and slower query performance.

You can check index fragmentation using `sys.dm_db_index_physical_stats`:

```sql
-- Create a sample table and index
CREATE TABLE SalesOrders (
    OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1,1),
    OrderDate DATETIME DEFAULT GETDATE(),
    CustomerID INT,
    OrderTotal DECIMAL(10, 2),
    Notes VARCHAR(255)
);

-- Create a non-clustered index on CustomerID
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IX_SalesOrders_CustomerID
ON SalesOrders (CustomerID);

-- Insert some data to cause fragmentation (simulated over time)
-- In a real scenario, this would happen from ongoing DML operations
INSERT INTO SalesOrders (CustomerID, OrderTotal) VALUES (101, 150.00);
INSERT INTO SalesOrders (CustomerID, OrderTotal) VALUES (102, 200.00);
INSERT INTO SalesOrders (CustomerID, OrderTotal) VALUES (101, 120.00);
INSERT INTO SalesOrders (CustomerID, OrderTotal) VALUES (103, 300.00);
INSERT INTO SalesOrders (CustomerID, OrderTotal) VALUES (102, 180.00);
INSERT INTO SalesOrders (CustomerID, OrderTotal) VALUES (104, 250.00);
DELETE FROM SalesOrders WHERE OrderID IN (2, 4); -- Deletes cause fragmentation
INSERT INTO SalesOrders (CustomerID, OrderTotal) VALUES (105, 400.00);
INSERT INTO SalesOrders (CustomerID, OrderTotal) VALUES (101, 110.00);

-- Check fragmentation for the IX_SalesOrders_CustomerID index
SELECT
    OBJECT_NAME(ips.object_id) AS TableName,
    i.name AS IndexName,
    ips.index_type_desc,
    ips.avg_fragmentation_in_percent,
    ips.page_count
FROM
    sys.dm_db_index_physical_stats(DB_ID(), OBJECT_ID('SalesOrders'), NULL, NULL, 'DETAILED') AS ips
INNER JOIN
    sys.indexes AS i ON ips.object_id = i.object_id AND ips.index_id = i.index_id
WHERE
    OBJECT_NAME(ips.object_id) = 'SalesOrders'
    AND i.name = 'IX_SalesOrders_CustomerID';
```

**General Guidelines for Fragmentation:**
* **5% - 30% fragmentation:** `ALTER INDEX REORGANIZE`
* **> 30% fragmentation:** `ALTER INDEX REBUILD`

### 2. `ALTER INDEX REORGANIZE`

`REORGANIZE` is a lighter-weight operation than `REBUILD`. It physically reorders the leaf-level pages of the index to match the logical order, and it compacts index pages to remove empty space.

**Key Characteristics:**
* **Online Operation:** Always an online operation, meaning it doesn't block concurrent DML operations (reads and writes) on the table.
* **Minimal Logging:** Generates less transaction log activity compared to `REBUILD`.
* **No Statistics Update (by default):** Doesn't automatically update index statistics (unless specified).
* **Smaller Fragmentation:** Best for indexes with moderate fragmentation (typically 5-30%).

**Syntax:**

```sql
ALTER INDEX { index_name | ALL }
ON [database_name.][schema_name.]table_or_view_name
REORGANIZE [ PARTITION = partition_number ]
[ WITH ( LOB_COMPACTION = { ON | OFF } ) ];
```

**Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Reorganize a specific non-clustered index**

```sql
ALTER INDEX IX_SalesOrders_CustomerID
ON SalesOrders
REORGANIZE;

-- Check fragmentation again (it should be reduced)
SELECT
    OBJECT_NAME(ips.object_id) AS TableName,
    i.name AS IndexName,
    ips.index_type_desc,
    ips.avg_fragmentation_in_percent,
    ips.page_count
FROM
    sys.dm_db_index_physical_stats(DB_ID(), OBJECT_ID('SalesOrders'), NULL, NULL, 'DETAILED') AS ips
INNER JOIN
    sys.indexes AS i ON ips.object_id = i.object_id AND ips.index_id = i.index_id
WHERE
    OBJECT_NAME(ips.object_id) = 'SalesOrders'
    AND i.name = 'IX_SalesOrders_CustomerID';
```

**Example 2: Reorganize all indexes on a table (including clustered index)**

```sql
ALTER INDEX ALL
ON SalesOrders
REORGANIZE;
```

**Example 3: Reorganize a specific partition of an index (for partitioned tables)**

```sql
-- Assume SalesOrders is partitioned and partition 2 is fragmented
-- ALTER INDEX IX_SalesOrders_CustomerID ON SalesOrders REORGANIZE PARTITION = 2;
```

### 3. `ALTER INDEX REBUILD`

`REBUILD` is a more drastic operation. It drops and recreates the index. This process completely removes fragmentation, compacts pages according to the fill factor, and updates index statistics.

**Key Characteristics:**
* **Online/Offline:** Can be performed `ONLINE` (Enterprise Edition and Azure SQL Database/Managed Instance) or `OFFLINE` (default for Standard/Express editions, or if `ONLINE=OFF` is specified).
  * **Offline:** Acquires exclusive locks on the table, blocking all access (reads and writes) during the operation. This is significant downtime for large tables.
  * **Online:** Allows concurrent DML operations during most of the rebuild process, with only brief schema stability (Sch-S) or schema modification (Sch-M) locks at the very beginning and end.
* **Full Defragmentation:** Eliminates all fragmentation.
* **Updates Statistics:** Automatically updates index statistics, which is crucial for the query optimizer.
* **Fill Factor:** Applies the specified `FILLFACTOR` (or the default if none is set) to the index pages.
* **Resource Intensive:** Can be resource-intensive (CPU, I/O, TempDB usage) for large tables.

**Syntax:**

```sql
ALTER INDEX { index_name | ALL }
ON [database_name.][schema_name.]table_or_view_name
REBUILD
[ PARTITION = ALL | PARTITION = partition_number ]
[ WITH ( <rebuild_index_option> [ ,...n ] ) ];

<rebuild_index_option> ::=
{
    PAD_INDEX = { ON | OFF }
    | FILLFACTOR = fillfactor
    | SORT_IN_TEMPDB = { ON | OFF }
    | IGNORE_DUP_KEY = { ON | OFF }
    | STATISTICS_NORECOMPUTE = { ON | OFF }
    | STATISTICS_INCREMENTAL = { ON | OFF }
    | ONLINE = { ON [ ( WAIT_AT_LOW_PRIORITY ( MAX_DURATION = <time> [ MINUTES ] , ABORT_AFTER_WAIT = { NONE | SELF | BLOCKERS } ) ) ] | OFF }
    | RESUMABLE = { ON | OFF }
    | MAXDOP = max_degree_of_parallelism
    | DATA_COMPRESSION = { NONE | ROW | PAGE } [ ON PARTITIONS ( { <partition_number_expression> | range } [ ,...n ] ) ]
    | XML_COMPRESSION = { ON | OFF } [ ON PARTITIONS ( { <partition_number_expression> | range } [ ,...n ] ) ]
    | DEDUP_TOKEN_LENGTH = { 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 }
}
```

**Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Rebuild a specific non-clustered index (offline)**

```sql
ALTER INDEX IX_SalesOrders_CustomerID
ON SalesOrders
REBUILD;

-- Check fragmentation again (should be 0 or very low)
SELECT
    OBJECT_NAME(ips.object_id) AS TableName,
    i.name AS IndexName,
    ips.index_type_desc,
    ips.avg_fragmentation_in_percent,
    ips.page_count
FROM
    sys.dm_db_index_physical_stats(DB_ID(), OBJECT_ID('SalesOrders'), NULL, NULL, 'DETAILED') AS ips
INNER JOIN
    sys.indexes AS i ON ips.object_id = i.object_id AND ips.index_id = i.index_id
WHERE
    OBJECT_NAME(ips.object_id) = 'SalesOrders'
    AND i.name = 'IX_SalesOrders_CustomerID';
```

**Example 2: Rebuild all indexes on a table (including clustered index) with `ONLINE = ON`**

```sql
-- This requires Enterprise Edition or Azure SQL Database/Managed Instance
ALTER INDEX ALL
ON SalesOrders
REBUILD WITH (ONLINE = ON);
```

**Example 3: Rebuild with specific options (e.g., FILLFACTOR, MAXDOP, DATA_COMPRESSION)**

```sql
-- Rebuild the clustered index (PRIMARY KEY in our case) with a specific fill factor
ALTER INDEX PK__SalesOrd__C3905BCF71661D79 -- Replace with your actual PK index name
ON SalesOrders
REBUILD WITH (
    FILLFACTOR = 90, -- Leave 10% free space for future inserts/updates
    SORT_IN_TEMPDB = ON, -- Use TempDB for sorting, can improve performance
    ONLINE = ON,
    MAXDOP = 4, -- Use up to 4 processors for the operation
    DATA_COMPRESSION = PAGE -- Apply page compression to the index
);

-- Rebuild a non-clustered index and disable automatic statistics update
ALTER INDEX IX_SalesOrders_CustomerID
ON SalesOrders
REBUILD WITH (
    STATISTICS_NORECOMPUTE = ON -- Prevents automatic statistics updates for this index
);
```

**Example 4: Resumable Online Index Rebuild (SQL Server 2017+ Enterprise Edition)**

This allows you to pause and resume large index rebuild operations, which is extremely useful for very large tables or limited maintenance windows.

```sql
-- Start a resumable online rebuild
ALTER INDEX IX_SalesOrders_CustomerID
ON SalesOrders
REBUILD WITH (ONLINE = ON, RESUMABLE = ON, MAX_DURATION = 240 MINUTES); -- Allow 4 hours then pause

-- Later, check status
SELECT name, percent_complete, total_execution_time FROM sys.index_resumable_operations;

-- Pause the operation
ALTER INDEX IX_SalesOrders_CustomerID
ON SalesOrders
PAUSE;

-- Resume the operation
ALTER INDEX IX_SalesOrders_CustomerID
ON SalesOrders
RESUME;

-- Abort the operation
ALTER INDEX IX_SalesOrders_CustomerID
ON SalesOrders
ABORT;
```

### 4. `ALTER INDEX DISABLE`

Disabling an index makes it unusable to the query optimizer. SQL Server retains the index definition (metadata) but deallocates the index pages. This is useful for temporary situations, like performing bulk inserts where you want to avoid the overhead of index maintenance during the load.

**Key Characteristics:**
* **Keeps Metadata:** The index definition remains in `sys.indexes`.
* **Frees Space:** Deallocates the space used by the index.
* **Cannot be used by Optimizer:** Queries will not use the disabled index.
* **Clustered Index Impact:** Disabling a clustered index makes the entire table inaccessible. All non-clustered indexes on that table also become unusable. Foreign key constraints referencing the table might also be disabled.
* **Re-enable by REBUILD:** You cannot "enable" a disabled index directly; you must `REBUILD` it.

**Syntax:**

```sql
ALTER INDEX { index_name | ALL }
ON [database_name.][schema_name.]table_or_view_name
DISABLE;
```

**Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Disable a non-clustered index**

```sql
ALTER INDEX IX_SalesOrders_CustomerID
ON SalesOrders
DISABLE;

-- Try to query (it will still work, but won't use the index)
SELECT * FROM SalesOrders WHERE CustomerID = 101;

-- Check if index is disabled
SELECT
    name AS IndexName,
    is_disabled
FROM
    sys.indexes
WHERE
    object_id = OBJECT_ID('SalesOrders') AND name = 'IX_SalesOrders_CustomerID';
```

**Example 2: Disable a clustered index (USE WITH CAUTION - it makes the table inaccessible)**

```sql
-- Get the name of the clustered index (usually starts with PK_)
SELECT name FROM sys.indexes WHERE object_id = OBJECT_ID('SalesOrders') AND type_desc = 'CLUSTERED';

-- ALTER INDEX PK__SalesOrd__C3905BCF71661D79 ON SalesOrders DISABLE;
-- SELECT * FROM SalesOrders; -- This query would fail if the clustered index is disabled
```

**Example 3: Re-enable a disabled index (by rebuilding it)**

```sql
ALTER INDEX IX_SalesOrders_CustomerID
ON SalesOrders
REBUILD;

-- Verify it's re-enabled
SELECT
    name AS IndexName,
    is_disabled
FROM
    sys.indexes
WHERE
    object_id = OBJECT_ID('SalesOrders') AND name = 'IX_SalesOrders_CustomerID';
```

### 5. `ALTER INDEX SET` Options

This allows you to change specific options of an index without performing a full rebuild or reorganize. Not all options can be set this way; some require a `REBUILD`.

**Syntax:**

```sql
ALTER INDEX { index_name | ALL }
ON [database_name.][schema_name.]table_or_view_name
SET ( <option_name> = { ON | OFF | value } [ ,...n ] );
```

**Key Options (common ones):**
* `ALLOW_ROW_LOCKS = { ON | OFF }`: Controls whether row locks are allowed. `OFF` forces page or table locks.
* `ALLOW_PAGE_LOCKS = { ON | OFF }`: Controls whether page locks are allowed. `OFF` forces row or table locks.
* `STATISTICS_NORECOMPUTE = { ON | OFF }`: Determines if statistics on the index are automatically recomputed by SQL Server. Setting to `ON` prevents automatic updates.
* `IGNORE_DUP_KEY = { ON | OFF }`: For unique indexes, specifies the error handling when duplicate key values are inserted. `ON` gives a warning and fails only the rows that violate uniqueness; `OFF` (default) rolls back the entire `INSERT` statement.

**Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Change locking behavior**

```sql
ALTER INDEX IX_SalesOrders_CustomerID
ON SalesOrders
SET (ALLOW_ROW_LOCKS = OFF, ALLOW_PAGE_LOCKS = ON); -- Only allow page locks for this index
```

**Example 2: Disable automatic statistics updates for an index**

```sql
ALTER INDEX IX_SalesOrders_CustomerID
ON SalesOrders
SET (STATISTICS_NORECOMPUTE = ON);

-- You would then manually update statistics using UPDATE STATISTICS or sp_updatestats
-- UPDATE STATISTICS SalesOrders.IX_SalesOrders_CustomerID;
```

**Example 3: Set IGNORE_DUP_KEY for a unique index**

```sql
-- Create a unique index
CREATE UNIQUE NONCLUSTERED INDEX UQ_SalesOrders_OrderTotal
ON SalesOrders (OrderTotal);

-- Try inserting duplicate data (will fail)
-- INSERT INTO SalesOrders (CustomerID, OrderTotal) VALUES (106, 150.00);

-- Change IGNORE_DUP_KEY
ALTER INDEX UQ_SalesOrders_OrderTotal
ON SalesOrders
SET (IGNORE_DUP_KEY = ON);

-- Now, try inserting duplicate data again. Only the offending row will fail, others will succeed.
INSERT INTO SalesOrders (CustomerID, OrderTotal) VALUES
(106, 150.00), -- This one will fail
(107, 500.00); -- This one will succeed
```

### Important Considerations for Interviews:

* **When to `REORGANIZE` vs. `REBUILD`:** Explain the fragmentation thresholds and the impact on performance and resources. `REORGANIZE` is less intrusive, `REBUILD` is more thorough.
* **`ONLINE = ON`:** Emphasize the importance of online operations in high-availability environments and that it's an Enterprise Edition feature (or Azure SQL DB/MI).
* **Locking:** Discuss the locking behavior of `REBUILD` (especially offline) and `REORGANIZE`.
* **Statistics:** Explain how `REBUILD` updates statistics and the role of `STATISTICS_NORECOMPUTE`.
* **`FILLFACTOR`:** Understand its purpose (leaving free space on index pages) and when to use it (e.g., for tables with frequent inserts at random points or updates that increase row size).
* **TempDB Usage:** `REBUILD` (especially with `SORT_IN_TEMPDB = ON`) can consume significant TempDB space.
* **Impact on Clustered Indexes:** Rebuilding a clustered index effectively rebuilds the entire table and all its non-clustered indexes (as non-clustered indexes point to the clustered key). Disabling a clustered index makes the table inaccessible.
* **Maintenance Plans:** Mention that these `ALTER INDEX` commands are typically automated through SQL Server Agent Jobs, Maintenance Plans, or third-party solutions (like Ola Hallengren's scripts).

By understanding these `ALTER INDEX` commands and their implications, you'll demonstrate a solid grasp of index management and performance tuning in SQL Server.
