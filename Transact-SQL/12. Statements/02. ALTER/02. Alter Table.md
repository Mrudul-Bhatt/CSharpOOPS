`ALTER TABLE` is one of the most fundamental and frequently used DDL (Data Definition Language) statements in Transact-SQL. It allows you to modify the structure of an existing table without having to drop and recreate it (which would mean losing all your data). Understanding its various clauses is crucial for any SQL Server professional.

Let's dive deep into the most important `ALTER TABLE` operations with code examples.

### 1. `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN`

This is used to add one or more new columns to an existing table.

**Syntax:**

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name
ADD column_name data_type [NULL | NOT NULL] [DEFAULT default_value] [CONSTRAINT constraint_name [PRIMARY KEY | UNIQUE | FOREIGN KEY | CHECK]];
```

**Key Considerations:**

* **NULL vs. NOT NULL:**
  * If you add a `NULL`able column, the operation is fast and can be done online (without blocking). Existing rows will have `NULL` in the new column.
  * If you add a `NOT NULL` column, you *must* provide a `DEFAULT` value. If not, the operation might fail if the table contains data, as SQL Server needs to populate the new column for existing rows.
* **Default Values:** Providing a `DEFAULT` value is highly recommended when adding a `NOT NULL` column to a table with existing data.
* **Constraints:** You can define constraints (PRIMARY KEY, UNIQUE, FOREIGN KEY, CHECK) directly when adding a column, or add them separately later.

**Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Add a NULLable column**

```sql
-- Create a sample table
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Insert some data
INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName) VALUES
(1, 'John', 'Doe'),
(2, 'Jane', 'Smith');

-- Add a NULLable Email column
ALTER TABLE Employees
ADD Email VARCHAR(100);

-- Verify the change
SELECT * FROM Employees;
```

**Example 2: Add a NOT NULL column with a DEFAULT value**

```sql
-- Add a NOT NULL column 'IsActive' with a default value of 1 (TRUE)
ALTER TABLE Employees
ADD IsActive BIT NOT NULL DEFAULT 1;

-- Verify the change
SELECT * FROM Employees;
```

**Example 3: Add a column with a CHECK constraint**

```sql
-- Add a 'Salary' column with a CHECK constraint to ensure it's positive
ALTER TABLE Employees
ADD Salary DECIMAL(10, 2) NULL CONSTRAINT CK_Employees_SalaryPositive CHECK (Salary >= 0);

-- Verify the change
SELECT * FROM Employees;
-- Test the constraint (this should fail)
-- INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Email, IsActive, Salary) VALUES (3, 'Bob', 'Johnson', 'bob@example.com', 1, -100);
```

---

### 2. `ALTER TABLE DROP COLUMN`

This is used to remove one or more columns from an existing table.

**Syntax:**

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name
DROP COLUMN column_name;
```

**Key Considerations:**

* **Data Loss:** Dropping a column will permanently delete all data in that column for all rows. This operation is irreversible without a backup.
* **Dependencies:** You cannot drop a column that is part of a primary key, unique key, foreign key, or has other objects (like indexes, default constraints, check constraints) directly dependent on it. You must drop the dependencies first.
* **Default/Check Constraints:** If a column has a named default constraint or check constraint, you usually need to drop the constraint first, or SQL Server might automatically drop the constraint for you when the column is dropped (behavior can vary, it's safer to explicitly drop dependent constraints).
* **Indexed Columns:** If a column is part of an index, the index will be dropped automatically when the column is dropped.

**Code Example:**

```sql
-- Drop the 'Email' column
ALTER TABLE Employees
DROP COLUMN Email;

-- Verify the change
SELECT * FROM Employees;
```

---

### 3. `ALTER TABLE ALTER COLUMN`

This is used to change the data type, length, nullability, or collation of an existing column.

**Syntax:**

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name
ALTER COLUMN column_name new_data_type [NULL | NOT NULL] [COLLATE collation_name];
```

**Key Considerations:**

* **Data Type Changes:**
  * **Widening (e.g., INT to BIGINT, VARCHAR(50) to VARCHAR(100)):** Generally safe and often an online operation.
  * **Narrowing (e.g., BIGINT to INT, VARCHAR(100) to VARCHAR(50)):** Risky. If existing data exceeds the new length, it will fail. This operation often requires an exclusive lock and can be slow for large tables.
  * **Changing Data Type (e.g., VARCHAR to INT):** Only possible if the existing data can be implicitly converted to the new type. If not, it will fail. This is typically a very slow operation for large tables.
* **Nullability Changes:**
  * `NULL` to `NOT NULL`: Only possible if the column contains no `NULL` values. If it does, the operation will fail.
  * `NOT NULL` to `NULL`: Always possible and generally fast.
* **Collation Changes:** Can be done if the column data type supports collation. This might be slow for large tables.
* **Dependencies:** Be aware of any dependencies (indexes, foreign keys, views, stored procedures) on the column being altered. Changes might break these dependencies or require their re-creation.

**Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Increase column length (widening)**

```sql
-- Change FirstName from VARCHAR(50) to VARCHAR(100)
ALTER TABLE Employees
ALTER COLUMN FirstName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL; -- Keep NOT NULL if it was originally NOT NULL

-- Verify the change (check column properties in SSMS or using system views)
-- SELECT COLUMN_NAME, DATA_TYPE, CHARACTER_MAXIMUM_LENGTH FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'Employees';
```

**Example 2: Change nullability (from NULL to NOT NULL)**

```sql
-- First, add a NULLable column
ALTER TABLE Employees
ADD Notes VARCHAR(255) NULL;

-- Update existing NULL values if any
UPDATE Employees
SET Notes = 'No notes provided'
WHERE Notes IS NULL;

-- Now, change it to NOT NULL (this will succeed if no NULLs exist)
ALTER TABLE Employees
ALTER COLUMN Notes VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL;
```

**Example 3: Change data type (risky, but demonstrates)**

```sql
-- Attempt to change Salary from DECIMAL to INT (will fail if fractional values exist)
-- This is generally a bad idea unless you are sure of the data.
-- ALTER TABLE Employees
-- ALTER COLUMN Salary INT NULL;
```

### 4. `ALTER TABLE ADD CONSTRAINT`

This is used to add new constraints (Primary Key, Unique, Foreign Key, Check, Default) to an existing table.

**Syntax (General):**

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name
ADD CONSTRAINT constraint_name CONSTRAINT_TYPE (column_list) [REFERENCES another_table (another_column_list)] [ON DELETE action] [ON UPDATE action] [NOT FOR REPLICATION];
```

**Key Considerations:**

* **Primary Key (PK):** Ensures unique identification of each row and enforces entity integrity. A table can have only one PK. The column(s) chosen must contain unique, non-NULL values.
* **Unique Key (UK):** Ensures uniqueness of values in a column or set of columns. A table can have multiple UKs. Unlike PK, UK columns can contain `NULL` (but only one `NULL` value for a unique constraint, as `NULL` is not equal to `NULL`).
* **Foreign Key (FK):** Enforces referential integrity between tables. It links a column (or set of columns) in one table to a primary key or unique key in another table.
  * `ON DELETE` and `ON UPDATE` actions: `NO ACTION` (default), `CASCADE`, `SET NULL`, `SET DEFAULT`.
* **Check Constraint (CK):** Enforces domain integrity by limiting the range of values that can be entered into a column.
* **Default Constraint (DF):** Provides a default value for a column if no value is explicitly specified during an `INSERT` operation.

**Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Add a Primary Key (if not already defined)**

```sql
-- Let's create a table without a PK first
CREATE TABLE Departments (
    DeptID INT,
    DeptName VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Add a Primary Key constraint
ALTER TABLE Departments
ADD CONSTRAINT PK_Departments PRIMARY KEY (DeptID);
```

**Example 2: Add a Unique Key**

```sql
-- Add a unique constraint on DeptName
ALTER TABLE Departments
ADD CONSTRAINT UQ_Departments_DeptName UNIQUE (DeptName);

-- Test uniqueness (this should fail)
-- INSERT INTO Departments (DeptID, DeptName) VALUES (1, 'HR');
-- INSERT INTO Departments (DeptID, DeptName) VALUES (2, 'HR');
```

**Example 3: Add a Foreign Key**

```sql
-- Assume Employees table exists and DeptID column is added
ALTER TABLE Employees
ADD DeptID INT NULL; -- Make it NULLable initially

-- Add the foreign key constraint
ALTER TABLE Employees
ADD CONSTRAINT FK_Employees_Departments
FOREIGN KEY (DeptID) REFERENCES Departments (DeptID)
ON DELETE SET NULL -- If a department is deleted, set employee's DeptID to NULL
ON UPDATE CASCADE; -- If DeptID changes in Departments, update in Employees

-- Insert some data to test FK
INSERT INTO Departments (DeptID, DeptName) VALUES (101, 'HR');
INSERT INTO Departments (DeptID, DeptName) VALUES (102, 'IT');

UPDATE Employees SET DeptID = 101 WHERE EmployeeID = 1;
UPDATE Employees SET DeptID = 102 WHERE EmployeeID = 2;

-- Verify FK (this should succeed)
SELECT E.FirstName, E.LastName, D.DeptName
FROM Employees E JOIN Departments D ON E.DeptID = D.DeptID;

-- Test ON DELETE SET NULL (this will set employee's DeptID to NULL)
DELETE FROM Departments WHERE DeptID = 101;
SELECT * FROM Employees;
```

**Example 4: Add a Check Constraint**

```sql
-- Add a check constraint to Employees to ensure Salary is non-negative
ALTER TABLE Employees
ADD CONSTRAINT CK_Employees_PositiveSalary CHECK (Salary >= 0);

-- Test the constraint (this should fail)
-- UPDATE Employees SET Salary = -100 WHERE EmployeeID = 2;
```

**Example 5: Add a Default Constraint**

```sql
-- Add a default constraint for HireDate (if column doesn't exist, add it first)
ALTER TABLE Employees
ADD HireDate DATE NULL;

ALTER TABLE Employees
ADD CONSTRAINT DF_Employees_HireDate DEFAULT GETDATE() FOR HireDate;

-- Insert a new employee without specifying HireDate
INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, IsActive, Salary) VALUES
(3, 'Chris', 'Evans', 1, 60000.00);

-- Verify HireDate is populated by default
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE EmployeeID = 3;
```

---

### 5. `ALTER TABLE DROP CONSTRAINT`

This is used to remove an existing constraint from a table.

**Syntax:**

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name
DROP CONSTRAINT constraint_name;
```

**Key Considerations:**

* You must specify the exact `constraint_name`. If you didn't provide one when creating, SQL Server auto-generated it (you can find it in `sys.objects` or SSMS properties).
* Dropping a primary key will also drop the clustered index created by default on the PK, if one existed.
* Dropping a foreign key means referential integrity is no longer enforced.
* Dropping a default constraint means new inserts without a value will get `NULL` (if nullable) or throw an error (if not nullable).

**Code Examples:**

```sql
-- Drop the default constraint
ALTER TABLE Employees
DROP CONSTRAINT DF_Employees_HireDate;

-- Drop the foreign key constraint
ALTER TABLE Employees
DROP CONSTRAINT FK_Employees_Departments;

-- Drop the unique constraint from Departments
ALTER TABLE Departments
DROP CONSTRAINT UQ_Departments_DeptName;

-- Drop the primary key constraint (will also drop clustered index if it's the clustered PK)
ALTER TABLE Departments
DROP CONSTRAINT PK_Departments;
```

---

### 6. `ALTER TABLE SWITCH PARTITION` (Advanced)

This is a powerful operation used in table partitioning to quickly move a data slice (partition) from one table (or partition) to another. It's an *almost* metadata-only operation, making it incredibly fast for large datasets.

**Prerequisites:**

* Both source and target tables (or partitions) must have identical schema (columns, data types, nullability, constraints, indexes).
* The target must be empty (unless switching a partition *into* an existing partition range, which is more complex).
* Both tables must be aligned on the same partition function (or one must be a non-partitioned table being switched into a partition).
* The data in the source partition must fit the target partition's boundary.

**Syntax:**

```sql
ALTER TABLE source_table
SWITCH [PARTITION source_partition_number] TO target_table [PARTITION target_partition_number];
```

**Key Use Cases:**

* **Archiving:** Quickly move old data from a "hot" table to an "archive" table.
* **Loading Data:** Load data into a staging table, then switch it into a production partitioned table, making the data immediately available without a large `INSERT`.
* **Maintenance:** Rebuild a single partition offline and then switch it back in.

**Conceptual Code Example (Setting up partitioning is complex, but this shows the `SWITCH` part):**

```sql
-- This is highly simplified. Real partitioning setup requires:
-- 1. CREATE PARTITION FUNCTION
-- 2. CREATE PARTITION SCHEME
-- 3. CREATE TABLE ON PARTITION SCHEME (or ALTER TABLE ADD PARTITION to existing)

-- Assume we have a partitioned fact table (e.g., SalesData partitioned by Month)
-- And a staging table with the same schema for new data
-- And an archive table for old data

-- Example Scenario: Move data for January 2024 from SalesData to SalesDataArchive
-- Assuming SalesData has a partition for '2024-01-31' at partition number 5

-- Step 1: Ensure the archive table (or its target partition) is empty
-- TRUNCATE TABLE SalesDataArchive_Jan2024; -- Or target partition

-- Step 2: Switch the partition
ALTER TABLE SalesData
SWITCH PARTITION 5 TO SalesDataArchive PARTITION 1; -- Assuming partition 1 in archive

-- After the switch, the data that was in partition 5 of SalesData is now in partition 1 of SalesDataArchive.
-- The operation is metadata-only.
```

### 7. `ALTER TABLE REBUILD` (Used for Rebuilding Tables, Often with Partitioning)

While `ALTER TABLE` is typically used for schema changes, it can also be used to rebuild a table, especially for heap tables (tables without a clustered index) or for managing partitioning. When a clustered index is rebuilt, it effectively rebuilds the table.

**Syntax (Example for rebuilding a heap):**

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name REBUILD;
```

**Key Use Cases:**

* **Heap Fragmentation:** Heaps can become fragmented over time due to inserts, updates, and deletes, leading to inefficient scan performance. Rebuilding a heap can defragment it.
* **Online/Offline Operations:** You can specify `WITH (ONLINE = ON | OFF)` when rebuilding.
* **Data Compression:** You can apply or change data compression during a rebuild.

**Code Example:**

```sql
-- Create a simple heap table
CREATE TABLE MyHeapTable (
    ID INT IDENTITY(1,1),
    DataCol VARCHAR(200)
);

-- Insert some data
INSERT INTO MyHeapTable (DataCol) VALUES ('Some data');
INSERT INTO MyHeapTable (DataCol) VALUES ('More data');
DELETE FROM MyHeapTable WHERE ID = 1; -- Creates fragmentation

-- Rebuild the heap table
ALTER TABLE MyHeapTable REBUILD;

-- You can also rebuild a clustered index using ALTER INDEX, which rebuilds the table itself.
```

### Important Notes for Interview Success:

* **Online vs. Offline Operations:** Be aware that some `ALTER TABLE` operations (e.g., adding `NOT NULL` columns without a default, changing data types, rebuilding clustered indexes) can take the table offline and acquire exclusive locks, potentially causing downtime. SQL Server Enterprise Edition often allows `ONLINE = ON` for many operations to minimize blocking.
* **Transaction Log:** Large `ALTER TABLE` operations can generate significant transaction log activity.
* **Performance Impact:** Understand the performance implications of each type of change, especially for large tables.
* **Error Handling:** In real-world scenarios, wrap `ALTER TABLE` statements in `TRY...CATCH` blocks, especially in deployment scripts.
* **Backward Compatibility:** Consider the impact on existing applications, queries, and views when changing table schemas.
* **Naming Conventions:** Always use clear and consistent naming conventions for tables, columns, and especially constraints.

By understanding these core `ALTER TABLE` operations and their nuances, you'll be well-prepared to discuss schema modifications in a Transact-SQL interview.
