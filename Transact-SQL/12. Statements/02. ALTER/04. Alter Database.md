`ALTER DATABASE` is a powerful Transact-SQL statement used to modify the configuration, properties, and physical characteristics of a SQL Server database. It's crucial for database administration, performance tuning, disaster recovery planning, and capacity management.

Let's explore the most important `ALTER DATABASE` operations with code examples.

### 1. `ALTER DATABASE SET` Options

This is one of the most frequently used clauses to change various database-level settings. These settings control behavior, performance, and recovery.

**Syntax (General):**

```sql
ALTER DATABASE database_name
SET option_name { ON | OFF | value } [ WITH <termination_option> ];
```

**Commonly Used `SET` Options for Interviews:**

* **`RECOVERY { FULL | BULK_LOGGED | SIMPLE }`**:
  * **Purpose:** Controls the transaction logging behavior and the database's ability to recover from data loss.
  * **`FULL`**: All transactions are fully logged. Allows point-in-time recovery to any transaction when combined with full and transaction log backups. Essential for mission-critical databases where no data loss is acceptable.
  * **`BULK_LOGGED`**: Minimally logs some bulk operations (e.g., `SELECT INTO`, `BULK INSERT`, `CREATE INDEX`). Allows recovery to the end of a backup, but not to a specific point in time if a minimally logged operation occurred. Useful for large data loads where performance is critical, but only for the duration of the load.
  * **`SIMPLE`**: Minimal logging. Transaction log is truncated automatically when checkpoints occur, freeing up space. Only allows recovery to the last full or differential backup. No point-in-time recovery. Suitable for development/test databases or data warehouses where data can be easily reloaded.
  * **Why it's important:** Direct impact on disaster recovery strategy, backup requirements, and transaction log growth.

  **Code Example:**
    ```sql
    -- Create a sample database
    CREATE DATABASE TestDB;
    GO

    USE TestDB;
    GO

    -- Set recovery model to FULL (default for new databases in most cases)
    ALTER DATABASE TestDB
    SET RECOVERY FULL;
    GO

    -- Set recovery model to SIMPLE
    ALTER DATABASE TestDB
    SET RECOVERY SIMPLE;
    GO

    -- Set recovery model to BULK_LOGGED
    ALTER DATABASE TestDB
    SET RECOVERY BULK_LOGGED;
    GO

    USE master;
    GO
    DROP DATABASE TestDB;
    GO
    ```

* **`COMPATIBILITY_LEVEL = { 160 | 150 | 140 | ... }`**:
  * **Purpose:** Controls the behavior of SQL Server features to be compatible with a specific version of the SQL Server Database Engine. This is crucial during upgrades or migrations.
  * **Why it's important:** Ensures that existing applications continue to function as expected after a SQL Server upgrade, even if the database engine version is newer. Allows you to test new features by changing the compatibility level without upgrading the entire server instance.
  * `160` (SQL Server 2022)
  * `150` (SQL Server 2019)
  * `140` (SQL Server 2017)

  **Code Example:**
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE CompatibilityTestDB;
    GO

    -- Check current compatibility level (will be the server's default, e.g., 160 for SQL Server 2022)
    SELECT name, compatibility_level FROM sys.databases WHERE name = 'CompatibilityTestDB';

    -- Set compatibility level to SQL Server 2017
    ALTER DATABASE CompatibilityTestDB
    SET COMPATIBILITY_LEVEL = 140;
    GO

    -- Verify the change
    SELECT name, compatibility_level FROM sys.databases WHERE name = 'CompatibilityTestDB';

    DROP DATABASE CompatibilityTestDB;
    GO
    ```

* **`AUTO_CLOSE { ON | OFF }`**:
  * **Purpose:** Controls whether the database is automatically shut down and resources are freed after the last user connection closes.
  * **`ON`**: Closes the database and frees resources. Can cause performance overhead due to repeated startup/shutdown.
  * **`OFF`**: Keeps the database open and resources allocated, even when no users are connected. Generally recommended for production databases for better performance.
  * **Why it's important:** Performance impact on frequently accessed databases. `ON` is typically only for very small, infrequently accessed databases, or client-side databases like those in SQL Server Express.

  **Code Example:**
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE AutoCloseTestDB;
    GO

    -- Set AUTO_CLOSE to ON (not recommended for production)
    ALTER DATABASE AutoCloseTestDB
    SET AUTO_CLOSE ON;
    GO

    -- Set AUTO_CLOSE to OFF (recommended for production)
    ALTER DATABASE AutoCloseTestDB
    SET AUTO_CLOSE OFF;
    GO

    DROP DATABASE AutoCloseTestDB;
    GO
    ```

* **`AUTO_SHRINK { ON | OFF }`**:
  * **Purpose:** Controls whether data and log files automatically shrink when free space percentages drop below a certain threshold.
  * **`ON`**: Automatically shrinks files.
  * **`OFF`**: Prevents automatic shrinking.
  * **Why it's important:** Generally **not recommended** to set `AUTO_SHRINK ON` in production. It can lead to severe performance issues due to high fragmentation, increased I/O, and constant re-growing of files. Manual, planned shrinking with proper defragmentation is preferred.

  **Code Example:**
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE AutoShrinkTestDB;
    GO

    -- Set AUTO_SHRINK to ON (generally NOT recommended)
    ALTER DATABASE AutoShrinkTestDB
    SET AUTO_SHRINK ON;
    GO

    -- Set AUTO_SHRINK to OFF (recommended)
    ALTER DATABASE AutoShrinkTestDB
    SET AUTO_SHRINK OFF;
    GO

    DROP DATABASE AutoShrinkTestDB;
    GO
    ```

* **`READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT { ON | OFF }`**:
  * **Purpose:** Enables row versioning for `READ COMMITTED` isolation level. This allows readers to access the last committed version of data without being blocked by writers, and writers are not blocked by readers.
  * **`ON`**: Enables `READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT` (RCSI).
  * **`OFF`**: Disables RCSI (default).
  * **Why it's important:** Significant performance improvement for OLTP workloads by reducing blocking. Requires `TempDB` space for version store. A very common best practice for modern SQL Server applications.

  **Code Example:**
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE RCSI_TestDB;
    GO

    -- Enable READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT
    ALTER DATABASE RCSI_TestDB
    SET READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT ON;
    GO

    -- Verify (look for is_read_committed_snapshot_on = 1)
    SELECT name, is_read_committed_snapshot_on FROM sys.databases WHERE name = 'RCSI_TestDB';

    -- Disable READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT
    -- ALTER DATABASE RCSI_TestDB SET READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT OFF;
    -- Note: Turning OFF requires no active connections.
    -- ALTER DATABASE RCSI_TestDB SET READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT OFF WITH ROLLBACK IMMEDIATE;
    -- GO

    DROP DATABASE RCSI_TestDB;
    GO
    ```

* **`SINGLE_USER | MULTI_USER | RESTRICTED_USER`**:
  * **Purpose:** Controls access to the database.
  * **`SINGLE_USER`**: Only one user connection allowed (typically `sysadmin`). Used for maintenance tasks that require exclusive access (e.g., restoring a database, running `DBCC CHECKDB` with repair).
  * **`MULTI_USER`**: Normal operating mode, allows multiple concurrent connections.
  * **`RESTRICTED_USER`**: Only members of the `db_owner`, `dbcreator`, or `sysadmin` roles can connect. Useful for a quick pre-maintenance check or allowing only privileged users during an application update.
  * **Why it's important:** Essential for managing downtime during maintenance windows.

  **Code Example:**
    ```sql
    USE master;
    GO

    CREATE DATABASE MaintenanceDB;
    GO

    -- Set to single-user mode (blocks all other connections)
    ALTER DATABASE MaintenanceDB
    SET SINGLE_USER WITH ROLLBACK IMMEDIATE; -- Important: Kicks out existing users

    -- Now, only one connection (your current connection) can access MaintenanceDB.
    -- To demonstrate, open a new SSMS query window and try to connect to MaintenanceDB, it will fail.

    -- Set back to multi-user mode
    ALTER DATABASE MaintenanceDB
    SET MULTI_USER;
    GO

    -- Set to restricted user mode
    ALTER DATABASE MaintenanceDB
    SET RESTRICTED_USER WITH ROLLBACK AFTER 30 SECONDS; -- Gives users time to finish
    GO

    -- Set back to multi-user mode
    ALTER DATABASE MaintenanceDB
    SET MULTI_USER;
    GO

    DROP DATABASE MaintenanceDB;
    GO
    ```

### 2. `ALTER DATABASE MODIFY FILE` / `MODIFY FILEGROUP`

These clauses are used to manage the physical files (data and log) and filegroups that make up a database. This is critical for capacity planning, performance, and storage management.

**Syntax (Modify File):**

```sql
ALTER DATABASE database_name
MODIFY FILE ( NAME = logical_file_name ,
    { SIZE = new_size | MAXSIZE = new_max_size | FILEGROWTH = new_filegrowth | FILENAME = 'new_physical_path' }
);
```

**Syntax (Modify Filegroup):**

```sql
ALTER DATABASE database_name
MODIFY FILEGROUP filegroup_name
{ DEFAULT | READONLY | READWRITE | AUTOGROW_ALL_FILES | AUTOGROW_SINGLE_FILE };
```

**Commonly Used Operations:**

* **Resizing Data and Log Files (`SIZE`, `FILEGROWTH`, `MAXSIZE`)**:
  * **Purpose:** Adjust the initial size, maximum size, and auto-growth increment of database files.
  * **Why it's important:** Prevents unexpected database growth from filling up disks, manages performance (pre-allocate space to reduce auto-growth events), and avoids frequently shrinking/growing files.
  * **`SIZE`**: Initial size of the file (or new current size).
  * **`FILEGROWTH`**: Amount of space added each time the file needs to grow (e.g., `100MB`, `10%`). Avoid small increments (can cause fragmentation) or very large increments (can cause long waits).
  * **`MAXSIZE`**: Maximum size the file can grow to. `UNLIMITED` is common for data files.

  **Code Example:**
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE FileMgmtDB;
    GO

    -- Get logical file names and current sizes
    SELECT name, physical_name, size_mb = size / 128.0, max_size_mb = max_size / 128.0, growth_mb = growth / 128.0
    FROM sys.database_files
    WHERE database_id = DB_ID('FileMgmtDB');

    -- Increase the size of the primary data file (TestDB_Data) to 500MB
    ALTER DATABASE FileMgmtDB
    MODIFY FILE ( NAME = FileMgmtDB , SIZE = 500MB ); -- Default name for primary data file is same as DB

    -- Set auto-growth for data file to 100MB with unlimited max size
    ALTER DATABASE FileMgmtDB
    MODIFY FILE ( NAME = FileMgmtDB, FILEGROWTH = 100MB, MAXSIZE = UNLIMITED );

    -- Set auto-growth for log file to 50MB with a max size of 1GB
    ALTER DATABASE FileMgmtDB
    MODIFY FILE ( NAME = FileMgmtDB_log, FILEGROWTH = 50MB, MAXSIZE = 1GB );

    -- Verify changes
    SELECT name, physical_name, size_mb = size / 128.0, max_size_mb = max_size / 128.0, growth_mb = growth / 128.0
    FROM sys.database_files
    WHERE database_id = DB_ID('FileMgmtDB');

    DROP DATABASE FileMgmtDB;
    GO
    ```

* **Moving Data and Log Files (`FILENAME`)**:
  * **Purpose:** Physically relocate database files to different drives or folders. This requires the database to be offline.
  * **Why it's important:** Disk space management, improving I/O performance by moving files to faster storage, or consolidating/distributing files across disks.

  **Code Example:**
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE MoveFileDB;
    GO

    -- Important: These paths must exist on your SQL Server.
    -- Use paths like 'C:\NewData\MoveFileDB.mdf' and 'D:\NewLog\MoveFileDB_log.ldf'

    -- Step 1: Set database offline (disconnects all users)
    ALTER DATABASE MoveFileDB
    SET OFFLINE WITH ROLLBACK IMMEDIATE;
    GO

    -- Step 2: Modify the file paths in SQL Server metadata
    ALTER DATABASE MoveFileDB
    MODIFY FILE ( NAME = MoveFileDB, FILENAME = 'C:\TempSQL\MoveFileDB.mdf' ); -- Replace with actual path
    GO

    ALTER DATABASE MoveFileDB
    MODIFY FILE ( NAME = MoveFileDB_log, FILENAME = 'C:\TempSQL\MoveFileDB_log.ldf' ); -- Replace with actual path
    GO

    -- Step 3: Physically move the .mdf and .ldf files using Windows Explorer or command prompt
    -- (You cannot do this with T-SQL, you need OS level access)
    -- For example:
    -- MOVE C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL16.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\DATA\MoveFileDB.mdf C:\TempSQL\MoveFileDB.mdf
    -- MOVE C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL16.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\DATA\MoveFileDB_log.ldf C:\TempSQL\MoveFileDB_log.ldf

    -- Step 4: Bring the database back online
    ALTER DATABASE MoveFileDB
    SET ONLINE;
    GO

    -- Verify the new paths
    SELECT name, physical_name FROM sys.database_files WHERE database_id = DB_ID('MoveFileDB');

    DROP DATABASE MoveFileDB;
    GO
    ```

* **Adding New Data Files / Filegroups (`ADD FILE` / `ADD FILEGROUP`)**:
  * **Purpose:** Extend database storage by adding more data files or by creating new filegroups to logically group files.
  * **Why it's important:** Spreading I/O across multiple disks, better performance for large tables/indexes (by placing them on separate filegroups), and managing growth.

  **Code Example:**
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE MultiFileDB;
    GO

    -- Add a new filegroup
    ALTER DATABASE MultiFileDB
    ADD FILEGROUP FG1;
    GO

    -- Add a new data file to the new filegroup (FG1)
    ALTER DATABASE MultiFileDB
    ADD FILE (
        NAME = MultiFileDB_Data2,
        FILENAME = 'C:\TempSQL\MultiFileDB_Data2.ndf', -- Use a proper path for your environment
        SIZE = 100MB,
        MAXSIZE = 500MB,
        FILEGROWTH = 50MB
    ) TO FILEGROUP FG1;
    GO

    -- Verify filegroups and files
    SELECT
        fg.name AS FilegroupName,
        df.name AS FileName,
        df.physical_name,
        df.size / 128.0 AS SizeMB
    FROM sys.filegroups AS fg
    JOIN sys.database_files AS df ON fg.data_space_id = df.data_space_id
    WHERE fg.database_id = DB_ID('MultiFileDB');

    -- Make a filegroup the default for new objects
    ALTER DATABASE MultiFileDB
    MODIFY FILEGROUP FG1 DEFAULT;
    GO

    -- New tables will now be created in FG1 by default
    -- CREATE TABLE MyTable (ID INT) ON FG1; -- or implicitly if FG1 is default

    DROP DATABASE MultiFileDB;
    GO
    ```

### 3. `ALTER DATABASE REMOVE FILE` / `REMOVE FILEGROUP`

Used to remove data files or entire filegroups from a database. This is less common but necessary for cleanup.

**Key Considerations:**
* **Empty Files:** You cannot remove a data file unless it is empty. You usually need to shrink it first to move data to other files within the same filegroup.
* **Empty Filegroups:** You cannot remove a filegroup unless it contains no files and no objects.
* **Primary Filegroup:** The primary filegroup and its primary data file (`.mdf`) cannot be removed.

**Code Example:**
```sql
-- Assume MultiFileDB with FG1 and MultiFileDB_Data2 exists from previous example

USE MultiFileDB;
GO

-- To remove MultiFileDB_Data2, first ensure it's empty by shrinking (if it contained data)
-- DBCC SHRINKFILE (MultiFileDB_Data2, EMPTYFILE);

-- Then remove the file
ALTER DATABASE MultiFileDB
REMOVE FILE MultiFileDB_Data2;
GO

-- Remove the filegroup (after ensuring it's empty of files and objects)
-- If FG1 was the default, you need to change the default back to PRIMARY first
ALTER DATABASE MultiFileDB
MODIFY FILEGROUP [PRIMARY] DEFAULT;
GO

ALTER DATABASE MultiFileDB
REMOVE FILEGROUP FG1;
GO

-- Verify removal
SELECT name, physical_name FROM sys.database_files WHERE database_id = DB_ID('MultiFileDB');
SELECT name FROM sys.filegroups WHERE database_id = DB_ID('MultiFileDB');

USE master;
GO
DROP DATABASE MultiFileDB;
GO
```

### 4. `ALTER DATABASE HADR` (Always On Availability Groups)

This is specific to configuring databases for Always On Availability Groups, a high-availability and disaster recovery solution.

**Syntax (Simplified for concept):**

```sql
-- On the primary replica
ALTER DATABASE database_name
SET HADR AVAILABILITY GROUP = 'AvailabilityGroupName';
```

**Why it's important (for roles involving HADR):**
* Enabling a database to participate in an Availability Group for high availability.
* Setting up synchronous/asynchronous replication.

**Code Example (Conceptual - requires AG setup):**
```sql
-- This assumes an Availability Group 'MyAG' already exists and you are on the primary replica.
-- The database 'MyDBForAG' must be in FULL recovery model and have a full backup taken.

-- ALTER DATABASE MyDBForAG
-- SET HADR AVAILABILITY GROUP = 'MyAG';
-- GO

-- This command marks the database to be joined to the Availability Group.
-- Subsequent steps involve restoring the database WITH NORECOVERY on secondary replicas
-- and then JOINING it to the AG.
```

### Important Notes for Interviews:

* **Offline vs. Online Operations:** Clearly differentiate which `ALTER DATABASE` commands require the database to be offline (`SINGLE_USER`, `MODIFY FILE FILENAME`) and which can be done online. `ROLLBACK IMMEDIATE` is key when taking databases offline forcefully.
* **Impact on Running Applications:** Emphasize the importance of planning and communicating downtime, especially for offline operations.
* **Transaction Log Management:** Discuss how `RECOVERY` model choices impact log growth and backup strategies.
* **Performance Implications:** Explain how auto-growth settings, file placement, and `READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT` affect performance.
* **Monitoring:** Mention how to monitor database file sizes, fragmentation, and other properties using `sys.database_files`, `sys.filegroups`, and `sys.dm_db_index_physical_stats`.
* **Best Practices:** Reinforce standard best practices (e.g., `AUTO_SHRINK OFF`, `AUTO_CLOSE OFF`, `READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT ON` for OLTP, appropriate `FILEGROWTH` settings).

Mastering `ALTER DATABASE` commands is essential for anyone responsible for the health, performance, and recoverability of SQL Server databases.
