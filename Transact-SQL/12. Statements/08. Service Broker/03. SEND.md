Let's delve deeply into the `SEND` statement in Transact-SQL, a core component of SQL Server Service Broker. `SEND` is the command used to transmit messages within an established dialog conversation, moving them from the sender's queue to the receiver's queue.

---

### `SEND` - Deep Dive

The `SEND` statement is used to place a message onto the transmission queue of the sending service, from where Service Broker then reliably delivers it to the target service's queue. It operates within the context of an ongoing dialog conversation that was previously initiated using `BEGIN DIALOG CONVERSATION`.

#### Purpose and Importance

1.  **Message Transmission:** The fundamental operation for sending data between services.
2.  **Transactional Delivery:** `SEND` is fully transactional. Messages are not actually transmitted from the local transmission queue until the transaction in which `SEND` is executed is committed. If the transaction rolls back, the message is not sent. This ensures atomicity and reliability.
3.  **Guaranteed Delivery and Ordering:** Within a single conversation, Service Broker guarantees that messages will be delivered exactly once and in the order they were sent. The `SEND` statement leverages this guarantee.
4.  **Asynchronous Communication:** `SEND` is inherently asynchronous. The calling application doesn't wait for the message to be received or processed by the target. It simply places the message in the local transmission queue, allowing the application to continue its work. Service Broker handles the background delivery.
5.  **Adherence to Contract:** Every `SEND` statement must specify a `MESSAGE TYPE` that is allowed by the `CONTRACT` established when the conversation was initiated. This enforces the communication protocol.

#### Key Concepts

* **Dialog Conversation:** The reliable, ordered, and secure communication channel established by `BEGIN DIALOG CONVERSATION`. `SEND` operates *within* this channel.
* **Conversation Handle:** The unique identifier (`uniqueidentifier`) obtained from `BEGIN DIALOG CONVERSATION`. This handle tells Service Broker which specific conversation the message belongs to.
* **Message Type:** Defines the structure and validation of the message content. When sending, you must specify a message type that the *sending side is allowed to send* according to the `CONTRACT`.
* **Contract:** Defines the allowed message types and their direction of flow for a conversation. If you try to `SEND` a message type that is not allowed by the contract for the sending service, the `SEND` statement will fail.
* **Transmission Queue:** A hidden internal queue (or a set of queues) where messages are temporarily stored after a `SEND` command but before the transaction commits and they are moved to the network.
* **Message Body:** The actual data payload of the message. This can be `VARBINARY(MAX)` (for any binary data) or `NVARCHAR(MAX)` (for text, especially XML).

#### Syntax

```sql
SEND ON CONVERSATION { conversation_handle | ( conversation_handle_array ) }
    MESSAGE TYPE message_type_name
    [ ( message_body_expression ) ]
[ ; ]
```

* `conversation_handle`: The `uniqueidentifier` for the dialog conversation on which the message is being sent. This is the handle returned by `BEGIN DIALOG CONVERSATION`.
* `( conversation_handle_array )`: Allows sending the same message to multiple conversations simultaneously. This is less common in typical scenarios but can be useful for broadcasting.
* `MESSAGE TYPE message_type_name`: The name of the message type for the message being sent. This message type *must* be defined in the contract for the initiating side (if it's the first message) or for the responding side (if it's a reply).
* `( message_body_expression )`: The actual content of the message. This can be any expression that evaluates to `VARBINARY(MAX)` or `NVARCHAR(MAX)`. If the message type validation is XML-based, the content must be valid XML. If there's no message body, you can omit this.

#### How `SEND` Works (Behind the Scenes)

1.  **Validation:** Service Broker verifies that the `conversation_handle` is valid and that the `message_type_name` is allowed to be sent by the current service on the specified contract.
2.  **Internal Queueing:** The message is packaged with conversation metadata (source service, target service, conversation handle, message type, etc.) and placed into an internal transmission queue. This happens *within the current transaction*.
3.  **Transaction Dependency:** The message remains in the transmission queue, pending the outcome of the enclosing transaction.
4.  **Commit:** If the transaction commits, Service Broker then attempts to transmit the message to the target queue. This involves network communication, routing, and placing the message into the target's queue.
5.  **Rollback:** If the transaction rolls back, the message is removed from the transmission queue and is never sent.

#### Example Scenario (Continuing from `BEGIN DIALOG CONVERSATION` Example)

Let's continue with our order processing system.

**Services:**
* **Initiator:** `//AdventureWorks/OrderInitiatorService` (in `InitiatorDB`)
* **Target:** `//AdventureWorks/OrderProcessorService` (in `TargetDB`)

**Messages:**
* `//AdventureWorks/OrderRequest`: Contains order details (sent from Initiator to Target).
* `//AdventureWorks/OrderConfirmation`: Contains order processing status (sent from Target to Initiator).

**Contract:**
* `//AdventureWorks/OrderProcessingContract`: Defines `OrderRequest` (sent by initiator) and `OrderConfirmation` (sent by target).

#### Code Examples

GO
PRINT 'OrderProcessorService created.';

-- *** Part 4: Routing Configuration (for cross-database communication) ***

**Example 1: Sending an `OrderRequest` Message**

This is the most common use case: initiating a conversation and sending the first message.

```sql
USE InitiatorDB;
GO

PRINT '--- Example 1: Sending an OrderRequest Message ---';

DECLARE @conversation_handle UNIQUEIDENTIFIER;
DECLARE @orderXml NVARCHAR(MAX);

SET @orderXml = N'<Order><OrderID>1001</OrderID><CustomerName>John Doe</CustomerName><Amount>150.75</Amount><Items><Item><Name>Laptop</Name><Qty>1</Qty></Item><Item><Name>Mouse</Name><Qty>1</Qty></Item></Items></Order>';

-- Begin a transaction, as SEND is transactional
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
    -- Start the conversation
    BEGIN DIALOG CONVERSATION @conversation_handle
        FROM SERVICE [//AdventureWorks/OrderInitiatorService]
        TO SERVICE '//AdventureWorks/OrderProcessorService'
        ON CONTRACT [//AdventureWorks/OrderProcessingContract]
        WITH ENCRYPTION = OFF, LIFETIME = 3600; -- 1 hour lifetime

    PRINT 'Conversation started. Handle: ' + CAST(@conversation_handle AS NVARCHAR(MAX));

    -- Send the message using the conversation handle and message type
    SEND ON CONVERSATION @conversation_handle
        MESSAGE TYPE [//AdventureWorks/OrderRequest]
        (@orderXml);

    PRINT 'OrderRequest message sent for OrderID 1001.';
COMMIT TRANSACTION; -- Commit the transaction to ensure message is placed in transmission queue

-- You can inspect the transmission queue (optional, for observation)
-- SELECT * FROM sys.transmission_queue; -- Note: This might not show if the message is immediately transmitted
GO

-- To see the message actually land, you'd switch to TargetDB and RECEIVE.
-- (This part will be covered in the RECEIVE explanation, but conceptually this is where it goes)
```

**Example 2: Sending a Reply Message (`OrderConfirmation`) from the Target Service**

This demonstrates the other side of the conversation using `SEND` as a response.

```sql
USE TargetDB;
GO

PRINT '--- Example 2: Sending a Reply Message (OrderConfirmation) from Target Service ---';

DECLARE @received_conversation_handle UNIQUEIDENTIFIER;
DECLARE @message_type_name SYSNAME;
DECLARE @message_body VARBINARY(MAX);
DECLARE @responseXml NVARCHAR(MAX);
DECLARE @orderId INT;

-- Begin a transaction to receive and send
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
    -- Receive the OrderRequest message
    WAITFOR (
        RECEIVE TOP(1)
            @received_conversation_handle = conversation_handle,
            @message_type_name = message_type_name,
            @message_body = message_body
        FROM OrderProcessorQueue
    ), TIMEOUT 5000; -- Wait up to 5 seconds

    IF @received_conversation_handle IS NOT NULL
    BEGIN
        PRINT 'Received message type: ' + @message_type_name;
        PRINT 'Received message body: ' + CONVERT(NVARCHAR(MAX), @message_body);

        IF @message_type_name = '//AdventureWorks/OrderRequest'
        BEGIN
            -- Extract OrderID for confirmation
            SET @orderId = (SELECT XML_VALUE(@message_body).value('/Order[1]/OrderID[1]', 'INT'));
            SET @responseXml = N'<OrderConfirmation><OrderID>' + CAST(@orderId AS NVARCHAR(MAX)) + '</OrderID><Status>Processed</Status><Message>Your order has been received and is being processed.</Message></OrderConfirmation>';

            -- Send the OrderConfirmation message back to the initiator
            -- Notice we use the @received_conversation_handle
            SEND ON CONVERSATION @received_conversation_handle
                MESSAGE TYPE [//AdventureWorks/OrderConfirmation]
                (@responseXml);
            PRINT 'OrderConfirmation message sent for OrderID ' + CAST(@orderId AS NVARCHAR(MAX));

            -- End the conversation from the target side (important to release resources)
            END CONVERSATION @received_conversation_handle;
            PRINT 'Conversation ended from target side.';
        END
    END
    ELSE
    BEGIN
        PRINT 'No messages received within the timeout from OrderProcessorQueue.';
    END
COMMIT TRANSACTION; -- Commit to process the receive and send the response
GO
```

**Example 3: Handling Errors During `SEND` (Transactional Behavior)**

This example demonstrates how `SEND` behavior changes with `ROLLBACK`.

```sql
USE InitiatorDB;
GO

PRINT '--- Example 3: Handling Errors During SEND (Transactional Behavior) ---';

DECLARE @conversation_handle UNIQUEIDENTIFIER;
DECLARE @orderXml NVARCHAR(MAX);

SET @orderXml = N'<Order><OrderID>1002</OrderID><CustomerName>Jane Doe</CustomerName></Order>';

BEGIN TRANSACTION;
    -- Start the conversation
    BEGIN DIALOG CONVERSATION @conversation_handle
        FROM SERVICE [//AdventureWorks/OrderInitiatorService]
        TO SERVICE '//AdventureWorks/OrderProcessorService'
        ON CONTRACT [//AdventureWorks/OrderProcessingContract];
    PRINT 'Conversation for OrderID 1002 started. Handle: ' + CAST(@conversation_handle AS NVARCHAR(MAX));

    -- Send the message
    SEND ON CONVERSATION @conversation_handle
        MESSAGE TYPE [//AdventureWorks/OrderRequest]
        (@orderXml);
    PRINT 'OrderRequest message for OrderID 1002 sent (within transaction).';

    -- Simulate an error condition
    IF 1 = 1 -- Always true for demo
    BEGIN
        PRINT 'Simulating an error and rolling back transaction...';
        ROLLBACK TRANSACTION; -- This will prevent the message from being sent
        PRINT 'Transaction rolled back.';
    END
    ELSE
    BEGIN
        COMMIT TRANSACTION;
        PRINT 'Transaction committed.';
    END
GO

-- Now, check the target queue. The message for OrderID 1002 should NOT be there.
USE TargetDB;
GO
SELECT conversation_handle, message_type_name, CONVERT(NVARCHAR(MAX), message_body) AS message_body_text
FROM OrderProcessorQueue;
GO
USE InitiatorDB;
GO
-- If the conversation was ended as part of the rollback, it might disappear from sys.conversation_endpoints too.
SELECT conversation_handle, state, is_initiator, far_service
FROM sys.conversation_endpoints;
GO
```

**Cleanup:**

```sql
USE master;
GO

-- Drop logins
IF LOGIN_ID('LimitedAppUserLogin') IS NOT NULL DROP LOGIN LimitedAppUserLogin;
GO

-- Drop databases (this implicitly cleans up all Service Broker objects within them)
DROP DATABASE InitiatorDB;
DROP DATABASE TargetDB;
GO

PRINT 'All demo databases and objects cleaned up.';
```

The `SEND` statement is deceptively simple but powerful due to its transactional nature and its reliance on the robust Service Broker conversation framework. Understanding how `SEND` works within a transaction, its dependency on `BEGIN DIALOG CONVERSATION` and `CONTRACT` definitions, and its role in asynchronous, reliable messaging is crucial for anyone working with SQL Server Service Broker.
