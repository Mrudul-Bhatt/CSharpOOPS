Let's explore `SET IDENTITY_INSERT` and `SET ROWCOUNT` deeply with code examples in Microsoft SQL Server. These `SET` options provide granular control over specific aspects of data manipulation and query execution.

### 1. `SET IDENTITY_INSERT`

`SET IDENTITY_INSERT` is a powerful and specific `SET` option that allows explicit values to be inserted into the identity column of a table. By default, SQL Server automatically generates values for identity columns, making it impossible to insert your own values directly. `SET IDENTITY_INSERT` temporarily overrides this default behavior.

**Key Aspects of `SET IDENTITY_INSERT`:**

* **Purpose:** To explicitly specify values for an identity column during `INSERT` operations.
* **Identity Column:** An identity column is a special type of column in a table (usually an integer data type) that automatically generates sequential numeric values when new rows are added to the table. It's commonly used for primary keys to ensure uniqueness.
* **Enabling/Disabling:**
    * `SET IDENTITY_INSERT <table_name> ON;`: Enables explicit identity column insertion for the specified table.
    * `SET IDENTITY_INSERT <table_name> OFF;`: Disables explicit identity column insertion for the specified table, reverting to automatic generation.
* **Rules and Restrictions:**
    1.  **One Table at a Time:** Only one table in a given session can have `IDENTITY_INSERT` set to `ON` at any given time. If you try to set it `ON` for a second table while another table already has it `ON`, an error will occur.
    2.  **Session Scope:** The setting is specific to the current session (connection). It does not affect other connections or the server's global behavior.
    3.  **Permissions:** You must have `ALTER` permission on the table or `INSERT` permission with ownership of the table to use `SET IDENTITY_INSERT`.
    4.  **`INSERT` Statement:** Once `IDENTITY_INSERT` is `ON`, the `INSERT` statement **must** explicitly provide a value for the identity column. If you don't, an error will occur.
    5.  **Turning `OFF`:** It is crucial to turn `IDENTITY_INSERT` `OFF` after you are done inserting explicit values. Leaving it `ON` can lead to issues with subsequent `INSERT` statements by other parts of your application that expect automatic identity generation.
    6.  **Does NOT Reset Identity Seed:** `SET IDENTITY_INSERT` does not automatically update or reset the current identity seed of the table. If you insert a high value and then turn `IDENTITY_INSERT OFF`, the next automatically generated identity value might still be based on the previous highest value *before* your explicit insert, potentially leading to duplicate key errors if the auto-generated value conflicts with your explicitly inserted value. To handle this, you might need to use `DBCC CHECKIDENT` (covered in more advanced topics).

**When to Use `SET IDENTITY_INSERT`:**

* **Data Migration/Import:** When moving data from an old system or another database where primary key values need to be preserved.
* **Merging Data:** Combining data from multiple sources where you want to retain original IDs.
* **Correcting Data:** In rare cases, to fix specific identity values that might have been corrupted or need adjustment.
* **Restoring from Backup (partial):** If restoring a subset of data from a backup, you might need to use `IDENTITY_INSERT` to put the original identity values back.

**Code Examples for `SET IDENTITY_INSERT`:**

First, let's create a test database and table with an identity column:

```sql
-- Setup: Create a test database and table with an IDENTITY column
IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT name FROM sys.databases WHERE name = N'IdentityInsertDemo')
CREATE DATABASE IdentityInsertDemo;
GO

USE IdentityInsertDemo;
GO

CREATE TABLE dbo.Employees (
    EmployeeID INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY, -- IDENTITY(seed, increment)
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50)
);
GO

-- Insert some initial data (EmployeeID will be auto-generated)
INSERT INTO dbo.Employees (FirstName, LastName) VALUES ('Alice', 'Smith');
INSERT INTO dbo.Employees (FirstName, LastName) VALUES ('Bob', 'Johnson');
GO

SELECT * FROM dbo.Employees;
-- Expected: EmployeeID 1 for Alice, 2 for Bob
```

**Example 1: Default Behavior (Cannot insert into identity column)**

```sql
USE IdentityInsertDemo;
GO

-- This will fail because you cannot explicitly insert into an IDENTITY column by default
BEGIN TRY
    INSERT INTO dbo.Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName)
    VALUES (100, 'Charlie', 'Brown');
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
    SELECT ERROR_NUMBER() AS ErrorNumber,
           ERROR_MESSAGE() AS ErrorMessage;
END CATCH;
GO

SELECT * FROM dbo.Employees;
-- Expected error: "Cannot insert explicit value for identity column in table 'Employees' when IDENTITY_INSERT is set to OFF."
```

**Example 2: Using `SET IDENTITY_INSERT ON` to insert explicit values**

```sql
USE IdentityInsertDemo;
GO

-- Enable IDENTITY_INSERT for the Employees table
SET IDENTITY_INSERT dbo.Employees ON;
GO

-- Now, we can explicitly insert a value into the EmployeeID column
INSERT INTO dbo.Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName)
VALUES (100, 'Charlie', 'Brown');
GO

-- We can also insert another row with a different explicit ID
INSERT INTO dbo.Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName)
VALUES (50, 'Diana', 'Prince');
GO

-- Crucial: Turn IDENTITY_INSERT OFF after you are done
SET IDENTITY_INSERT dbo.Employees OFF;
GO

SELECT * FROM dbo.Employees ORDER BY EmployeeID;
-- Expected: EmployeeID 1, 2, 50, 100
```

**Example 3: Trying to insert automatically after explicit inserts (potential issues)**

This example shows a potential pitfall: the identity seed is not automatically updated by `SET IDENTITY_INSERT`.

```sql
USE IdentityInsertDemo;
GO

-- Insert a new row without specifying EmployeeID
-- SQL Server will generate the next ID based on its internal tracking.
-- If the highest auto-generated ID was 2, and you inserted 50 and 100,
-- the next auto-generated ID would likely be 3.
-- If you then inserted a new row manually, it might conflict with an existing ID.
-- To make this work robustly after explicit inserts, you might need DBCC CHECKIDENT.
INSERT INTO dbo.Employees (FirstName, LastName)
VALUES ('Eve', 'Adams');
GO

SELECT * FROM dbo.Employees ORDER BY EmployeeID;
-- Expected: EmployeeID 3 for Eve (if the highest auto-generated ID before explicit inserts was 2)
```
**Explanation of Potential Issue:** If you had `EmployeeID` 1 and 2, then manually inserted `100`, the next auto-generated `ID` would still be `3` (based on the previous maximum *auto-generated* ID). If you then inserted `50` (which is less than `100`), the `IDENTITY_INSERT` still succeeded. The next auto-generated ID after `IDENTITY_INSERT` would still be `3` (not `101`). If you then tried to insert another row like `INSERT INTO ... VALUES ('Frank', 'White')`, it would get `ID = 3`. If you had manually inserted ID 3 (or any ID that conflicts) while `IDENTITY_INSERT ON`, you'd get a primary key violation.

To ensure the identity seed is correctly reset after using `SET IDENTITY_INSERT` with high values, you typically run:

```sql
-- After using SET IDENTITY_INSERT ON with high values,
-- you might need to reseed the identity column to prevent future conflicts
DBCC CHECKIDENT ('dbo.Employees', RESEED);
-- Then optionally, to make it reseed to the true maximum value + 1:
DBCC CHECKIDENT ('dbo.Employees', RESEED, 0); -- This sets seed to current max + 1
GO

-- Now insert a new row, and it will get the correct next ID
INSERT INTO dbo.Employees (FirstName, LastName) VALUES ('Frank', 'White');
GO
SELECT * FROM dbo.Employees ORDER BY EmployeeID;
-- Frank should now get EmployeeID 101 (or whatever the highest ID + 1 is)
```

**Cleanup for `IDENTITY_INSERT` demo:**

```sql
USE master;
GO
DROP DATABASE IdentityInsertDemo;
GO
```

### 2. `SET ROWCOUNT`

`SET ROWCOUNT` is a legacy `SET` option that was used to limit the number of rows returned by a query or affected by a DML operation (like `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`). It specifies the maximum number of rows to be processed by the next statement in the current session.

**Key Aspects of `SET ROWCOUNT`:**

* **Purpose:** To limit the number of rows affected by a `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statement.
* **Global Limiter (for session):** Once `SET ROWCOUNT N` is issued, it applies to *all subsequent applicable statements* in that session until it is explicitly reset (`SET ROWCOUNT 0`) or the session ends.
* **Value:**
    * `SET ROWCOUNT N;`: Limits operations to `N` rows.
    * `SET ROWCOUNT 0;`: Turns off the rowcount limit, meaning all rows will be processed.
* **Deprecation (for `SELECT`):** For `SELECT` statements, `SET ROWCOUNT` is largely superseded by the `TOP` clause (e.g., `SELECT TOP N ...`) which offers more flexibility and is preferred for limiting `SELECT` results.
* **Behavior with `TOP`:** If both `SET ROWCOUNT` and `TOP` are specified, the smaller of the two values is used.
* **Not Affected by `WHERE` or `ORDER BY`:** `SET ROWCOUNT` applies *after* the `WHERE` clause has filtered rows but *before* the `ORDER BY` clause sorts them. This can lead to unpredictable results if you need specific rows based on ordering.

**When to Use `SET ROWCOUNT` (and why `TOP` is often better):**

* **Legacy Code:** You might encounter it in older scripts or stored procedures.
* **DML Operations (limited use):** For `UPDATE` or `DELETE` operations where you want to limit the number of rows affected in a single batch. However, even here, combining `TOP` with `ORDER BY` for DML (e.g., `DELETE TOP (100) FROM MyTable WHERE ... ORDER BY ID;`) is often more precise.
* **`TOP` is generally preferred for `SELECT`:**
    * `TOP` is part of the `SELECT` statement itself, making the intent clear for that specific query.
    * `TOP` can be combined with `ORDER BY` to return the *N* top/bottom rows based on specific criteria. `SET ROWCOUNT` processes rows in their physical order (or whatever order the query plan dictates), which isn't guaranteed.
    * `TOP` supports `WITH TIES` for including rows that tie for the last position.

**Code Examples for `SET ROWCOUNT`:**

First, let's create a test database and table:

```sql
-- Setup: Create a test database and table
IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT name FROM sys.databases WHERE name = N'RowcountDemo')
CREATE DATABASE RowcountDemo;
GO

USE RowcountDemo;
GO

CREATE TABLE dbo.Orders (
    OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1,1),
    OrderDate DATE,
    TotalAmount DECIMAL(10, 2),
    OrderStatus VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'Pending'
);
GO

-- Insert some data
INSERT INTO dbo.Orders (OrderDate, TotalAmount) VALUES
('2023-01-15', 100.00),
('2023-01-20', 250.50),
('2023-02-01', 75.25),
('2023-02-10', 500.00),
('2023-03-05', 120.00),
('2023-03-10', 30.00),
('2023-04-01', 99.99),
('2023-04-05', 150.00);
GO

SELECT * FROM dbo.Orders ORDER BY OrderID;
-- Expected: 8 rows
```

**Example 1: Limiting `SELECT` results with `SET ROWCOUNT`**

```sql
USE RowcountDemo;
GO

PRINT '--- SET ROWCOUNT 3 for SELECT ---';
SET ROWCOUNT 3; -- Limit to 3 rows
GO

SELECT OrderID, OrderDate, TotalAmount FROM dbo.Orders ORDER BY OrderID;
-- Expected: Only 3 rows returned, but WHICH 3 might vary if ORDER BY was not specified,
-- as ROWCOUNT applies *before* ORDER BY.
-- With ORDER BY OrderID, you'll get 1, 2, 3.
GO

-- Turn off ROWCOUNT
SET ROWCOUNT 0;
GO

SELECT OrderID, OrderDate, TotalAmount FROM dbo.Orders ORDER BY OrderID;
-- Expected: All 8 rows returned
GO
```

**Example 2: Limiting `UPDATE` operations with `SET ROWCOUNT`**

```sql
USE RowcountDemo;
GO

PRINT '--- SET ROWCOUNT 2 for UPDATE ---';
SET ROWCOUNT 2; -- Limit to 2 rows
GO

-- Update the OrderStatus for the first 2 orders (based on internal physical order)
UPDATE dbo.Orders
SET OrderStatus = 'Shipped'
WHERE OrderStatus = 'Pending';
GO

SELECT OrderID, OrderStatus FROM dbo.Orders ORDER BY OrderID;
-- Expected: Only 2 rows will have OrderStatus 'Shipped'
-- If run multiple times, it will update the next 2 pending rows.
-- The order of update is not guaranteed by ROWCOUNT alone.
-- To get specific rows updated, you'd combine with TOP and ORDER BY in the UPDATE statement.
```

**Example 3: Limiting `DELETE` operations with `SET ROWCOUNT`**

```sql
USE RowcountDemo;
GO

PRINT '--- SET ROWCOUNT 1 for DELETE ---';
SET ROWCOUNT 1; -- Limit to 1 row
GO

DELETE FROM dbo.Orders
WHERE OrderStatus = 'Pending'; -- Deletes one pending row

SELECT * FROM dbo.Orders ORDER BY OrderID;
-- Expected: One less row that was 'Pending'
GO

-- Reset ROWCOUNT
SET ROWCOUNT 0;
GO
```

**Example 4: `SET ROWCOUNT` vs. `TOP` (The preferred way for SELECT)**

```sql
USE RowcountDemo;
GO

-- Reset ROWCOUNT to 0 to ensure it doesn't interfere
SET ROWCOUNT 0;
GO

PRINT '--- Using TOP for SELECT (preferred) ---';
-- This explicitly returns the top 3 orders by OrderID
SELECT TOP 3 OrderID, OrderDate, TotalAmount
FROM dbo.Orders
ORDER BY OrderID;
GO

PRINT '--- Using TOP with WITH TIES ---';
-- If multiple rows tie for the 3rd position in TotalAmount, WITH TIES includes them.
SELECT TOP 3 WITH TIES OrderID, OrderDate, TotalAmount
FROM dbo.Orders
ORDER BY TotalAmount DESC;
GO
```

**Cleanup for `ROWCOUNT` demo:**

```sql
USE master;
GO
DROP DATABASE RowcountDemo;
GO
```

In summary, `SET IDENTITY_INSERT` is a specialized tool for controlled management of identity columns during specific data operations. `SET ROWCOUNT` is a legacy feature, especially for `SELECT` statements, where the `TOP` clause is the modern and more robust alternative. For DML, while `ROWCOUNT` can still be used, `TOP` with `ORDER BY` generally provides more predictable control.
