Sure, let's delve deeply into `SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER ON/OFF` in Transact-SQL.

### What `SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER ON/OFF` Does

The `SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER` statement controls how SQL Server interprets double quotation marks (`"`).

* **`SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER ON` (Recommended and Standard Behavior):**
    * When `ON`, double quotation marks (`"`) are interpreted as **delimiters for identifiers**. This means you can use double quotes to enclose object names (tables, columns, views, stored procedures, etc.) that:
        * Are [SQL Server reserved keywords](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/language-elements/reserved-keywords-transact-sql).
        * Contain spaces or special characters (e.g., `My Table`, `Order#`).
    * When `ON`, string literals (actual text values) **must be enclosed in single quotation marks (`'`)**. Double quotes for string literals are not allowed and will result in an error or be interpreted as an identifier.
    * This is the **SQL-92 standard** behavior.

* **`SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER OFF` (Non-Standard, Legacy Behavior):**
    * When `OFF`, double quotation marks (`"`) are interpreted as **delimiters for string literals**. This means you can use double quotes to enclose actual text values (e.g., `"Hello World"` is treated like `'Hello World'`).
    * When `OFF`, identifiers that are reserved keywords or contain special characters **must be enclosed in square brackets (`[]`)** (e.g., `[My Table]`). Double quotes will not work for identifiers.
    * This behavior is **non-standard** and is primarily for backward compatibility with older versions of SQL Server or other database systems that use this convention.

### Why `SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER` is Important (and Frequently Asked)

1.  **Compliance with SQL Standards:**
    * `SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER ON` aligns your Transact-SQL code with the ANSI SQL-92 standard. This is generally a good practice for portability and maintainability.

2.  **Handling "Illegal" Identifiers:**
    * It allows you to use object names that would otherwise be invalid without special delimiters. For example, if you have a column named `Order Date` (which contains a space), you *must* enclose it in `"` (if `QUOTED_IDENTIFIER ON`) or `[]` (if `QUOTED_IDENTIFIER OFF` or just generally).
    * Consider identifiers that are also SQL Server reserved keywords, like `GROUP` or `SELECT`. If you create a column named `[GROUP]`, you must always reference it with delimiters.

3.  **Impact on Object Creation:**
    * This is a crucial point: When you create or alter database objects like **views, stored procedures, user-defined functions, and triggers**, the `QUOTED_IDENTIFIER` setting that was in effect *at the time of creation* is stored with the object definition.
    * This means that when the object is executed later, it will always use the `QUOTED_IDENTIFIER` setting that was in force when it was created, **regardless of the current session's `QUOTED_IDENTIFIER` setting**.
    * This can lead to subtle bugs if you create objects with `QUOTED_IDENTIFIER OFF` and then try to execute them from a session where it's `ON`, or vice versa, especially if you rely on double quotes for strings.
    * **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) by default sets `QUOTED_IDENTIFIER ON` for new queries and when creating new objects.**

4.  **Required for Indexed Views and Computed Columns:**
    * `SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER ON` is a **mandatory requirement** for creating and working with:
        * Indexed Views (also known as materialized views).
        * Indexes on computed columns.
        * Filters on XML indexes.
        * Many other schema-bound objects.
    * If you attempt to create these objects with `QUOTED_IDENTIFIER OFF`, SQL Server will raise an error.

5.  **Ambiguity Avoidance:**
    * It removes ambiguity. When `ON`, `"` always means "this is an identifier," and `'` always means "this is a string." This makes code easier to read and less prone to errors.

### Default Behavior

* For new connections, SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) and most common client drivers (ODBC, OLE DB, .NET SqlClient) implicitly set `SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER ON` by default.
* The `USER_OPTIONS` column in `sys.dm_exec_sessions` can show you the current `SET` options for a session.

### Code Examples

Let's illustrate the behavior of `SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER ON` and `OFF`.

First, create a test table with an identifier that needs quoting:

```sql
-- Create a table with a column name that needs quoting
IF OBJECT_ID('dbo.Order Details', 'U') IS NOT NULL
    DROP TABLE dbo.[Order Details];
GO

CREATE TABLE dbo.[Order Details] (
    OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    [Order Date] DATE, -- Column name with space needs quoting (square brackets or double quotes)
    Quantity INT,
    [Unit Price] DECIMAL(10, 2), -- Another column with space
    Remarks NVARCHAR(255)
);
GO

INSERT INTO dbo.[Order Details] (OrderID, [Order Date], Quantity, [Unit Price], Remarks)
VALUES (1, '2025-05-27', 2, 50.00, 'First order');
GO

SELECT OrderID, [Order Date], Remarks FROM dbo.[Order Details];
GO
```

**Example 1: `SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER ON` (Recommended Practice)**

```sql
PRINT '--- SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER ON ---';
SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER ON;
GO

-- Using double quotes for identifiers is allowed
SELECT "OrderID", "Order Date", "Remarks"
FROM "dbo"."Order Details"
WHERE "OrderID" = 1;
GO

-- Using single quotes for string literals is mandatory
SELECT OrderID, "Order Date", Remarks
FROM [dbo].[Order Details]
WHERE Remarks = 'First order'; -- This is correct
GO

-- Attempting to use double quotes for string literals will fail or be misinterpreted as an identifier
PRINT 'Attempting to use double quotes for string literal (will error):';
BEGIN TRY
    SELECT OrderID FROM dbo.[Order Details] WHERE Remarks = "First order"; -- This will throw an error: Invalid column name 'First order'.
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
    PRINT 'Error: ' + ERROR_MESSAGE();
END CATCH
GO
```

**Output/Behavior with `SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER ON`:**

* The `SELECT` statements using double quotes for identifiers will execute successfully.
* The `SELECT` statement using single quotes for the string literal `Remarks = 'First order'` will also succeed.
* The `SELECT` statement attempting to use `Remarks = "First order"` will result in an error: "Invalid column name 'First order'." This is because `SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER ON` forces SQL Server to interpret `"First order"` as an identifier, not a string literal. Since no column named "First order" exists, it fails.

**Example 2: `SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER OFF` (Legacy/Non-Standard)**

```sql
PRINT '--- SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER OFF ---';
SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER OFF;
GO

-- Using square brackets for identifiers is necessary for names with spaces/keywords
SELECT [OrderID], [Order Date], [Remarks]
FROM [dbo].[Order Details]
WHERE [OrderID] = 1;
GO

-- Using double quotes for string literals is allowed
SELECT OrderID, [Order Date], Remarks
FROM [dbo].[Order Details]
WHERE Remarks = "First order"; -- This is correct when OFF
GO

-- Using single quotes for string literals is also allowed
SELECT OrderID, [Order Date], Remarks
FROM [dbo].[Order Details]
WHERE Remarks = 'First order'; -- This is also correct
GO

-- Attempting to use double quotes for identifiers will fail or be misinterpreted as string literals
PRINT 'Attempting to use double quotes for identifier (will fail):';
BEGIN TRY
    SELECT "OrderID" FROM "dbo"."Order Details" WHERE "OrderID" = 1; -- This will fail: Invalid object name '"dbo"."Order Details"'.
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
    PRINT 'Error: ' + ERROR_MESSAGE();
END CATCH
GO
```

**Output/Behavior with `SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER OFF`:**

* The `SELECT` statements using square brackets `[]` for identifiers will execute successfully.
* The `SELECT` statement using `Remarks = "First order"` (double quotes for string literal) will succeed.
* The `SELECT` statement using `Remarks = 'First order'` (single quotes for string literal) will also succeed.
* The `SELECT` statement attempting to use `SELECT "OrderID"` and `"dbo"."Order Details"` will result in an error: "Invalid object name '"dbo"."Order Details"'." This is because `SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER OFF` forces SQL Server to interpret `"OrderID"` and `"dbo"."Order Details"` as string literals, not identifiers, leading to an invalid object name.

**Example 3: Impact on Stored Procedure Creation**

This demonstrates the persistence of the `QUOTED_IDENTIFIER` setting.

```sql
-- Create a procedure with SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER OFF
SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER OFF;
GO

CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.usp_GetOrderDetails_NoQuotedIdentifier
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT OrderID, [Order Date], Remarks
    FROM [dbo].[Order Details]
    WHERE Remarks = "First order"; -- Double quotes for string literal here
END;
GO

-- Create a procedure with SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER ON
SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER ON;
GO

CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.usp_GetOrderDetails_WithQuotedIdentifier
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT OrderID, [Order Date], Remarks
    FROM [dbo].[Order Details]
    WHERE Remarks = 'First order'; -- Single quotes for string literal here
END;
GO

-- Now, execute both procedures from a session where QUOTED_IDENTIFIER is ON (default for SSMS)
SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER ON;
GO

PRINT '--- Executing usp_GetOrderDetails_NoQuotedIdentifier (created with OFF) ---';
EXEC dbo.usp_GetOrderDetails_NoQuotedIdentifier;
GO

PRINT '--- Executing usp_GetOrderDetails_WithQuotedIdentifier (created with ON) ---';
EXEC dbo.usp_GetOrderDetails_WithQuotedIdentifier;
GO

-- Cleanup
DROP PROCEDURE dbo.usp_GetOrderDetails_NoQuotedIdentifier;
DROP PROCEDURE dbo.usp_GetOrderDetails_WithQuotedIdentifier;
DROP TABLE dbo.[Order Details];
GO
```

**Observation:**

* Both stored procedures will execute successfully, **even though the session executing them has `SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER ON`**.
* This is because the `QUOTED_IDENTIFIER` setting was *persisted* at the time of their creation. `usp_GetOrderDetails_NoQuotedIdentifier` will internally use the `OFF` interpretation, and `usp_GetOrderDetails_WithQuotedIdentifier` will use the `ON` interpretation.
* This persistence is a key concept to grasp for interviews and debugging.

### Recommendation

Always use `SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER ON;`

* It's the SQL-92 standard.
* It improves code clarity and reduces ambiguity.
* It's required for advanced SQL Server features like indexed views.
* It prevents subtle bugs related to how identifiers and string literals are interpreted.

While SQL Server allows `SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER OFF` for backward compatibility, it should generally be avoided in new development. If you inherit code that uses it, be aware of its implications. When dealing with identifiers that require quoting (e.g., names with spaces), using square brackets `[]` is always safe, regardless of the `QUOTED_IDENTIFIER` setting. However, for string literals, consistently using single quotes `'` is always the correct and standard approach.
