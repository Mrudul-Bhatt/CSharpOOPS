Sure, let's dive deeply into `SET ARITHABORT ON/OFF` in Transact-SQL, including its critical implications.

### What `SET ARITHABORT ON/OFF` Does

`SET ARITHABORT` controls whether SQL Server terminates a query when an arithmetic overflow or a divide-by-zero error occurs during expression evaluation.

* **`SET ARITHABORT ON` (Recommended and Default for Database Compatibility Levels $\ge$ 90):**
    * When `ON`, if an arithmetic overflow or divide-by-zero error occurs during the execution of a `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statement, the **entire query (or batch/transaction, depending on the context and if `XACT_ABORT` is also `ON`) is immediately terminated and rolled back**.
    * This provides a strict and predictable error-handling mechanism.
    * This is the **ANSI SQL standard** behavior.

* **`SET ARITHABORT OFF` (Legacy Behavior):**
    * When `OFF`, if an arithmetic overflow or divide-by-zero error occurs, the query might **not necessarily terminate**. Instead:
        * For `SELECT` statements, a `NULL` value is often returned for the problematic expression.
        * For `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` statements, the row might be inserted/updated/deleted, but the problematic value might be stored as `NULL` or replaced with a boundary value, or the operation might silently fail for that specific expression without terminating the entire statement/batch.
        * A warning message might be generated (e.g., "Arithmetic overflow error converting expression to data type int." or "Divide by zero error encountered.").
    * This non-standard behavior can lead to inconsistent or incorrect results being stored in the database without immediately alerting the user or application to a severe problem.

### Why `SET ARITHABORT` is Crucial (and a Key Interview Topic)

1.  **Data Integrity and Accuracy:**
    * This is the most critical reason. `SET ARITHABORT ON` ensures that if a calculation produces an invalid result (like overflow or division by zero), the operation that depends on it (e.g., the `INSERT` or `UPDATE`) is completely aborted. This prevents "bad" or unexpected data from being written to your database.
    * With `OFF`, silently inserting `NULL`s or boundary values when an error occurs can lead to very subtle and hard-to-detect data corruption over time.

2.  **Predictable Query Behavior:**
    * When `ARITHABORT ON`, you know exactly what will happen if an arithmetic error occurs: the query stops. This makes debugging and error handling much more straightforward.
    * With `ARITHABORT OFF`, the behavior can be inconsistent and depends on the specific context of the operation, making it harder to predict and troubleshoot.

3.  **Required for Performance and Optimization:**
    * `SET ARITHABORT ON` is **mandatory** for SQL Server to perform certain query optimizations. Specifically, it is required for:
        * **Indexed Views (Materialized Views):** You cannot create or reference indexed views if `ARITHABORT` is `OFF` at the time of creation or query.
        * **Indexes on Computed Columns:** Similar to indexed views, these require `ARITHABORT ON`.
        * **Filtered Indexes:** Require `ARITHABORT ON`.
        * **Certain types of deterministic behavior:** Many advanced optimization techniques rely on the deterministic nature of expressions, which is guaranteed when `ARITHABORT ON`.
    * Attempting to create these objects with `ARITHABORT OFF` will result in an error. Querying them with `ARITHABORT OFF` might prevent the optimizer from using the index, leading to significant performance degradation.

4.  **Interaction with `SET XACT_ABORT ON`:**
    * `SET ARITHABORT ON` often works in conjunction with `SET XACT_ABORT ON`. If `ARITHABORT ON` detects an error, it terminates the query. If `XACT_ABORT ON` is also set, the entire transaction will be rolled back. This creates a very robust "all or nothing" transactional boundary for arithmetic errors.

### Types of Errors Affected

`SET ARITHABORT` primarily affects:

* **Arithmetic Overflow:** When a calculation produces a value too large or too small for the data type it's being stored in (e.g., trying to put 100,000 into a `SMALLINT`).
* **Divide-by-Zero:** When a number is divided by zero.

Other types of errors, like constraint violations or string truncation, are generally handled by other `SET` options (e.g., `ANSI_WARNINGS` for string truncation) or directly by SQL Server's error handling.

### Default Behavior

* For new connections through SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or most common client drivers (ODBC, OLE DB, .NET SqlClient), `SET ARITHABORT ON` is typically set by default.
* However, the **database compatibility level** also plays a significant role. For compatibility levels 90 (SQL Server 2005) and above, `ARITHABORT` defaults to `ON`. For older compatibility levels, it might default to `OFF`. It's always best to explicitly set it to `ON` in your code.

### Code Examples

Let's illustrate the behavior of `SET ARITHABORT ON` and `OFF`.

First, create a test table:

```sql
-- Create a test table
IF OBJECT_ID('dbo.Calculations', 'U') IS NOT NULL
    DROP TABLE dbo.Calculations;
GO

CREATE TABLE dbo.Calculations (
    ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Numerator INT,
    Denominator INT,
    Result_INT INT,
    BigNumber INT
);
GO

INSERT INTO dbo.Calculations (ID, Numerator, Denominator, BigNumber) VALUES
(1, 10, 2, 2000000000), -- No error expected
(2, 10, 0, 100),       -- Divide by zero
(3, 2147483647, 1, 0), -- Max INT value
(4, 1, 1, 2000000000);  -- Will cause overflow if multiplied by 2 in INT
GO

SELECT * FROM dbo.Calculations;
GO
```

**Example 1: `SET ARITHABORT OFF` (Legacy Behavior)**

```sql
PRINT '--- SET ARITHABORT OFF ---';
SET ARITHABORT OFF;
SET ANSI_WARNINGS OFF; -- Turn off ANSI_WARNINGS to truly see silent behavior, as it can cause warnings

BEGIN TRY
    PRINT 'Attempting SELECT with divide by zero...';
    SELECT ID, Numerator / Denominator AS DivisionResult
    FROM dbo.Calculations
    WHERE ID = 2; -- Denominator is 0
    PRINT 'SELECT completed (might return NULL for error, no termination).';

    PRINT 'Attempting INSERT with arithmetic overflow...';
    INSERT INTO dbo.Calculations (ID, Numerator, Denominator, Result_INT, BigNumber)
    VALUES (5, 1, 1, (2147483647 + 1), 1); -- Will cause INT overflow if inserted directly
    PRINT 'INSERT completed (might insert NULL or truncated value).';

    PRINT 'Attempting UPDATE with arithmetic overflow...';
    UPDATE dbo.Calculations
    SET BigNumber = BigNumber * 2 -- BigNumber is 2,000,000,000, times 2 overflows INT
    WHERE ID = 4;
    PRINT 'UPDATE completed (might update with NULL or truncated value).';

END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
    PRINT 'Error occurred: ' + ERROR_MESSAGE();
END CATCH

PRINT '--- Data after SET ARITHABORT OFF example ---';
SELECT * FROM dbo.Calculations ORDER BY ID;
GO
```

**Observation with `SET ARITHABORT OFF`:**

* For the `SELECT` with `ID = 2` (divide-by-zero):
    * You will see an output like:
        ```
        DivisionResult
        --------------
        NULL
        ```
    * And a warning message: `Warning: Null value is eliminated by an aggregate or other SET operation.` (if `ANSI_WARNINGS` is `ON`) or `Divide by zero error encountered.`
    * The query **does not terminate**. It returns `NULL` for the erroneous calculation.
* For the `INSERT` with `ID = 5` (overflow):
    * The `INSERT` statement itself might succeed, but the `Result_INT` column for `ID = 5` will likely be `NULL`. You might get a warning: "Arithmetic overflow error converting expression to data type int."
* For the `UPDATE` with `ID = 4` (overflow):
    * The `UPDATE` statement might succeed, but the `BigNumber` for `ID = 4` will likely become `NULL`. You might get a warning: "Arithmetic overflow error converting expression to data type int."
* **Crucially, the batch continues to execute after each error.** This can lead to silent data corruption or unexpected `NULL` values.

**Example 2: `SET ARITHABORT ON` (Recommended Practice)**

```sql
PRINT '--- SET ARITHABORT ON ---';
SET ARITHABORT ON;
SET ANSI_WARNINGS ON; -- Always keep ANSI_WARNINGS ON with ARITHABORT ON

BEGIN TRY
    PRINT 'Attempting SELECT with divide by zero...';
    SELECT ID, Numerator / Denominator AS DivisionResult
    FROM dbo.Calculations
    WHERE ID = 2; -- Denominator is 0
    PRINT 'SELECT completed (THIS WILL NOT BE REACHED ON ERROR).'; -- This print will likely not show

END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
    PRINT 'Error occurred in SELECT (divide by zero): ' + ERROR_MESSAGE();
END CATCH
GO

PRINT '--- After first block ---'; -- This will execute

BEGIN TRY
    PRINT 'Attempting INSERT with arithmetic overflow...';
    INSERT INTO dbo.Calculations (ID, Numerator, Denominator, Result_INT, BigNumber)
    VALUES (6, 1, 1, (2147483647 + 1), 1); -- Will cause INT overflow
    PRINT 'INSERT completed (THIS WILL NOT BE REACHED ON ERROR).';

END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
    PRINT 'Error occurred in INSERT (overflow): ' + ERROR_MESSAGE();
END CATCH
GO

PRINT '--- After second block ---';

BEGIN TRY
    PRINT 'Attempting UPDATE with arithmetic overflow...';
    UPDATE dbo.Calculations
    SET BigNumber = BigNumber * 2 -- BigNumber is 2,000,000,000, times 2 overflows INT
    WHERE ID = 4;
    PRINT 'UPDATE completed (THIS WILL NOT BE REACHED ON ERROR).';

END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
    PRINT 'Error occurred in UPDATE (overflow): ' + ERROR_MESSAGE();
END CATCH
GO

PRINT '--- Data after SET ARITHABORT ON example ---';
SELECT * FROM dbo.Calculations ORDER BY ID;
GO

-- Cleanup
DROP TABLE dbo.Calculations;
GO
```

**Observation with `SET ARITHABORT ON`:**

* For the `SELECT` with `ID = 2` (divide-by-zero):
    * The `SELECT` statement will immediately terminate, and control will jump to the `CATCH` block.
    * You will see: `Error occurred in SELECT (divide by zero): Divide by zero error encountered.`
    * The `PRINT` statement after the `SELECT` will **not** be reached.
* For the `INSERT` with `ID = 6` (overflow):
    * The `INSERT` statement will immediately terminate, and control will jump to the `CATCH` block.
    * You will see: `Error occurred in INSERT (overflow): Arithmetic overflow error converting expression to data type int.`
    * Product with `ID = 6` will **not** be inserted.
* For the `UPDATE` with `ID = 4` (overflow):
    * The `UPDATE` statement will immediately terminate, and control will jump to the `CATCH` block.
    * You will see: `Error occurred in UPDATE (overflow): Arithmetic overflow error converting expression to data type int.`
    * The `BigNumber` for `ID = 4` will **not** be updated to `NULL` (it remains `2000000000`).
* **Each error causes the current query/batch to terminate, and if within a transaction, it will mark the transaction as doomed (especially if combined with `XACT_ABORT ON`).** This ensures data integrity.

### Recommendation

Always use `SET ARITHABORT ON;`

* It aligns with ANSI SQL standards.
* It is crucial for maintaining data integrity by preventing silently incorrect results.
* It ensures predictable error handling, making your code more robust.
* It is a mandatory requirement for SQL Server to use powerful optimization features like indexed views and filtered indexes.

Unless you have a very specific, deeply analyzed, and well-understood legacy reason not to, `SET ARITHABORT ON` should be the default setting for all your Transact-SQL code, especially in stored procedures and functions.
