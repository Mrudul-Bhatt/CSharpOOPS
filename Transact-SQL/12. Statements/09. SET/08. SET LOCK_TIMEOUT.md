In Microsoft SQL Server, `SET LOCK_TIMEOUT` is a Transact-SQL statement that allows you to specify the maximum amount of time (in milliseconds) that a statement will wait to acquire a lock on a resource. If a statement waits longer than the `LOCK_TIMEOUT` setting, the blocked statement is automatically canceled, and an error message (Error 1222) is returned to the application.

This is particularly useful in environments where concurrency is high, and you want to prevent queries from hanging indefinitely due to locks held by other transactions. Rather than letting a query block for an extended period, you can set a timeout to fail fast and allow the application to handle the error or retry the operation.

### Key Aspects of `SET LOCK_TIMEOUT`:

1.  **Scope:** `SET LOCK_TIMEOUT` is a **session-level setting**. This means that once you set it for a connection (or session), it remains in effect for all subsequent statements within that same connection until it is explicitly changed or the connection is closed. It does not affect other connections or the server's default behavior.

2.  **Default Value:** The default `LOCK_TIMEOUT` value is **-1**, which means there is no timeout, and statements will wait indefinitely for a lock to be released.

3.  **Values:**
    * **-1 (Default):** Wait indefinitely for locks.
    * **0:** Do not wait at all. If a lock cannot be acquired immediately, the statement will fail immediately.
    * **Positive Integer (milliseconds):** Wait for the specified number of milliseconds before timing out.

4.  **Error Handling:** When a `LOCK_TIMEOUT` occurs, SQL Server returns an error message (Error 1222). It's crucial for applications to catch and handle this specific error.

5.  **Not for DDL Statements:** `CREATE DATABASE`, `ALTER DATABASE`, and `DROP DATABASE` statements do not honor the `SET LOCK_TIMEOUT` setting.

6.  **`@@LOCK_TIMEOUT` System Function:** You can retrieve the current `LOCK_TIMEOUT` setting for the current session using the `@@LOCK_TIMEOUT` system function.

### How it Helps:

* **Improved Responsiveness:** Prevents applications from appearing unresponsive due to long-running blocked queries.
* **Resource Management:** Helps in managing shared resources by preventing a single long-held lock from impacting other operations indefinitely.
* **Application Control:** Gives applications more control over how they react to lock contention.

### Code Examples from Microsoft SQL Server Transact-SQL Docs:

Let's illustrate `SET LOCK_TIMEOUT` with examples, inspired by the Microsoft Learn documentation.

**Scenario:** We'll create a simple table and demonstrate how `SET LOCK_TIMEOUT` works by simulating a lock.

**Step 1: Setup - Create a Test Table**

```sql
-- Create a test database (if not exists)
IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT name FROM sys.databases WHERE name = N'LockTimeoutDemo')
CREATE DATABASE LockTimeoutDemo;
GO

USE LockTimeoutDemo;
GO

-- Create a simple table
CREATE TABLE dbo.TestTable (
    ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(50)
);
GO

-- Insert some data
INSERT INTO dbo.TestTable (ID, Name) VALUES (1, 'Alice');
INSERT INTO dbo.TestTable (ID, Name) VALUES (2, 'Bob');
GO
```

**Step 2: Demonstrate Default Behavior (Infinite Wait)**

Open **two separate SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) query windows** or connections.

**Window 1 (Session 1):** Start a transaction and acquire a lock on a row, but don't commit or rollback.

```sql
-- Window 1 (Session 1)
USE LockTimeoutDemo;
GO

BEGIN TRANSACTION;
UPDATE dbo.TestTable SET Name = 'Alicia' WHERE ID = 1;
-- This transaction is intentionally left open to hold the lock
-- DO NOT COMMIT OR ROLLBACK YET
```

**Window 2 (Session 2):** Try to update the same row. By default, it will wait indefinitely.

```sql
-- Window 2 (Session 2)
USE LockTimeoutDemo;
GO

-- Check the current LOCK_TIMEOUT setting (should be -1 by default)
SELECT @@LOCK_TIMEOUT AS [Lock Timeout];
GO

-- Attempt to update the locked row - this will hang indefinitely
UPDATE dbo.TestTable SET Name = 'Alisha' WHERE ID = 1;
-- This statement will be blocked by Session 1
```

In **Window 2**, you'll notice that the `UPDATE` statement is "Executing query..." and never completes until you either commit or rollback the transaction in **Window 1**.

**Step 3: Setting a Lock Timeout**

Now, let's set a `LOCK_TIMEOUT` in **Window 2**.

**Window 1 (Session 1):** If the previous `UPDATE` is still running, cancel it. Then, restart the transaction to acquire the lock again.

```sql
-- Window 1 (Session 1) - If you previously committed/rolled back, restart the transaction
USE LockTimeoutDemo;
GO

BEGIN TRANSACTION;
UPDATE dbo.TestTable SET Name = 'Alicia' WHERE ID = 1;
-- Keep this transaction open
```

**Window 2 (Session 2):** Set a `LOCK_TIMEOUT` and then try the `UPDATE` again.

```sql
-- Window 2 (Session 2)
USE LockTimeoutDemo;
GO

-- Set LOCK_TIMEOUT to 5000 milliseconds (5 seconds)
SET LOCK_TIMEOUT 5000;
GO

-- Verify the new setting
SELECT @@LOCK_TIMEOUT AS [Lock Timeout];
GO

-- Attempt to update the locked row
-- This will now wait for a maximum of 5 seconds
UPDATE dbo.TestTable SET Name = 'Alisha' WHERE ID = 1;
GO
```

In **Window 2**, after approximately 5 seconds, you will receive an error message similar to this:

```
Msg 1222, Level 16, State 51, Line X
Lock request time out period exceeded.
```

This demonstrates that `SET LOCK_TIMEOUT` successfully terminated the blocked statement after the specified period.

**Step 4: Setting No Wait (Timeout 0)**

This is useful if you want to know immediately if a resource is locked and don't want to wait at all.

**Window 1 (Session 1):** Ensure the transaction is still open and holding the lock:

```sql
-- Window 1 (Session 1) - If needed, restart the transaction
USE LockTimeoutDemo;
GO

BEGIN TRANSACTION;
UPDATE dbo.TestTable SET Name = 'Alicia' WHERE ID = 1;
-- Keep this transaction open
```

**Window 2 (Session 2):** Set `LOCK_TIMEOUT` to 0.

```sql
-- Window 2 (Session 2)
USE LockTimeoutDemo;
GO

-- Set LOCK_TIMEOUT to 0 (no wait)
SET LOCK_TIMEOUT 0;
GO

-- Verify the new setting
SELECT @@LOCK_TIMEOUT AS [Lock Timeout];
GO

-- Attempt to update the locked row - this will fail immediately if locked
UPDATE dbo.TestTable SET Name = 'Alisha' WHERE ID = 1;
GO
```

In **Window 2**, you will immediately receive the `Msg 1222` error, as it doesn't wait for any time at all.

**Step 5: Reverting to Default Behavior (Infinite Wait)**

You can always revert the `LOCK_TIMEOUT` to its default infinite wait.

```sql
-- Window 2 (Session 2)
USE LockTimeoutDemo;
GO

-- Set LOCK_TIMEOUT back to -1 (infinite wait)
SET LOCK_TIMEOUT -1;
GO

-- Verify the setting
SELECT @@LOCK_TIMEOUT AS [Lock Timeout];
GO
```

**Step 6: Cleanup**

Remember to close the transactions and drop the test database/table.

**Window 1 (Session 1):**

```sql
-- Window 1 (Session 1)
USE LockTimeoutDemo;
GO

ROLLBACK TRANSACTION; -- Or COMMIT TRANSACTION;
GO
```

**Window 2 (Session 2):**

```sql
-- Window 2 (Session 2)
USE LockTimeoutDemo;
GO

-- Cleanup database (optional, only if you created it for this example)
USE master;
GO
DROP DATABASE LockTimeoutDemo;
GO
```

By understanding and utilizing `SET LOCK_TIMEOUT`, you can build more robust and resilient applications that interact with SQL Server, gracefully handling scenarios of lock contention.
