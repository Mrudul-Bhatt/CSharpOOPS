Sure, let's explore `SET ANSI_NULLS ON/OFF` deeply with code examples.

### What `SET ANSI_NULLS ON/OFF` Does

The `SET ANSI_NULLS` statement controls the behavior of comparison operators (`=`, `<>`, `!=`, `>=`, `<=`, `<`, `>`) when they are used with `NULL` values.

* **`SET ANSI_NULLS ON` (Recommended and Standard Behavior):**
    * When `ON`, a comparison of an expression with `NULL` (e.g., `column = NULL`, `column <> NULL`, `column != NULL`) always evaluates to `UNKNOWN`.
    * This is the **SQL-92 standard** behavior.
    * To check for `NULL` values when `ANSI_NULLS` is `ON`, you **must use `IS NULL` or `IS NOT NULL`**.

* **`SET ANSI_NULLS OFF` (Non-Standard, Legacy Behavior):**
    * When `OFF`, a comparison of an expression with `NULL` using the equality (`=`) operator evaluates to `TRUE` if both expressions are `NULL`.
    * Similarly, `NULL <> NULL` evaluates to `FALSE` (instead of `UNKNOWN`).
    * This behavior is **non-standard** and is primarily for backward compatibility with older versions of SQL Server or other database systems that use this convention.

### Why `SET ANSI_NULLS` is Important (and Frequently Asked)

1.  **Compliance with SQL Standards:**
    * `SET ANSI_NULLS ON` makes your Transact-SQL code adhere to the ANSI SQL-92 standard. This promotes consistency and portability of your database logic across different SQL-compliant systems.

2.  **Logical Consistency of `NULL`:**
    * The `NULL` value in SQL represents an unknown or missing value. It's not the same as zero or an empty string.
    * When something is unknown, you cannot logically assert that it is equal to another unknown thing, nor that it is not equal.
    * `SET ANSI_NULLS ON` correctly models this logic:
        * `NULL = NULL` is `UNKNOWN` (We don't know if two unknown values are the same).
        * `NULL <> NULL` is `UNKNOWN` (We don't know if two unknown values are different).
        * `5 = NULL` is `UNKNOWN`.
        * `'abc' = NULL` is `UNKNOWN`.
    * This consistent handling of `NULL` is crucial for reliable query results.

3.  **Impact on Object Creation:**
    * Similar to `SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER`, when you create or alter database objects like **views, stored procedures, user-defined functions, and triggers**, the `ANSI_NULLS` setting that was in effect *at the time of creation* is stored with the object definition.
    * When the object is executed later, it will always use the `ANSI_NULLS` setting that was in force when it was created, **regardless of the current session's `ANSI_NULLS` setting**.
    * This is a common source of confusion and bugs if not understood, as the behavior of `NULL` comparisons can change unexpectedly.
    * **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) by default sets `ANSI_NULLS ON` for new queries and when creating new objects.**

4.  **Required for Indexed Views, Computed Columns, etc.:**
    * `SET ANSI_NULLS ON` is a **mandatory requirement** for creating and working with:
        * Indexed Views (materialized views).
        * Indexes on computed columns.
        * Indexes on columns involved in filtered indexes.
        * Schema-bound objects.
    * If you attempt to create these objects with `ANSI_NULLS OFF`, SQL Server will raise an error. This is because these features require deterministic behavior from expressions, and `NULL` comparisons with `ANSI_NULLS OFF` can introduce non-deterministic results.

### Default Behavior

* For new connections, SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) and most common client drivers (ODBC, OLE DB, .NET SqlClient) implicitly set `SET ANSI_NULLS ON` by default.
* The `USER_OPTIONS` column in `sys.dm_exec_sessions` can show you the current `SET` options for a session.

### Code Examples

Let's illustrate the behavior of `SET ANSI_NULLS ON` and `OFF`.

First, create a test table with a nullable column:

```sql
-- Create a test table with a nullable column
IF OBJECT_ID('dbo.Employees', 'U') IS NOT NULL
    DROP TABLE dbo.Employees;
GO

CREATE TABLE dbo.Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName NVARCHAR(50),
    LastName NVARCHAR(50),
    ManagerID INT NULL -- This column can be NULL
);
GO

INSERT INTO dbo.Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, ManagerID) VALUES
(1, 'Alice', 'Smith', NULL), -- Alice has no manager
(2, 'Bob', 'Johnson', 1),    -- Bob reports to Alice
(3, 'Charlie', 'Brown', NULL); -- Charlie has no manager
GO

SELECT * FROM dbo.Employees;
GO
```

**Example 1: `SET ANSI_NULLS ON` (Recommended Practice)**

```sql
PRINT '--- SET ANSI_NULLS ON ---';
SET ANSI_NULLS ON;
GO

-- Query for employees with no manager (ManagerID is NULL)
-- This will return 0 rows when ANSI_NULLS is ON because NULL = NULL is UNKNOWN
PRINT 'Querying for ManagerID = NULL (will return 0 rows):';
SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName
FROM dbo.Employees
WHERE ManagerID = NULL;
GO

-- Query for employees WITH a manager (ManagerID is NOT NULL)
-- This will return 0 rows when ANSI_NULLS is ON because NULL <> NULL is UNKNOWN
PRINT 'Querying for ManagerID <> NULL (will return 0 rows):';
SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName
FROM dbo.Employees
WHERE ManagerID <> NULL;
GO

-- CORRECT way to query for NULL values when ANSI_NULLS is ON
PRINT 'Correct way to query for ManagerID IS NULL:';
SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName
FROM dbo.Employees
WHERE ManagerID IS NULL;
GO

PRINT 'Correct way to query for ManagerID IS NOT NULL:';
SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName
FROM dbo.Employees
WHERE ManagerID IS NOT NULL;
GO
```

**Output/Behavior with `SET ANSI_NULLS ON`:**

* `WHERE ManagerID = NULL` and `WHERE ManagerID <> NULL` will both return **0 rows**. This is the standard behavior: you cannot compare an unknown value (NULL) for equality or inequality with anything, including another unknown value. The result is `UNKNOWN`.
* `WHERE ManagerID IS NULL` will correctly return employees Alice and Charlie.
* `WHERE ManagerID IS NOT NULL` will correctly return employee Bob.

**Example 2: `SET ANSI_NULLS OFF` (Legacy/Non-Standard)**

```sql
PRINT '--- SET ANSI_NULLS OFF ---';
SET ANSI_NULLS OFF;
GO

-- Query for employees with no manager (ManagerID is NULL)
-- This will return rows where ManagerID is NULL when ANSI_NULLS is OFF
PRINT 'Querying for ManagerID = NULL (will return rows when OFF):';
SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName
FROM dbo.Employees
WHERE ManagerID = NULL;
GO

-- Query for employees WITH a manager (ManagerID is NOT NULL)
-- This will return 0 rows because NULL <> NULL is FALSE (not UNKNOWN)
PRINT 'Querying for ManagerID <> NULL (will return rows not null, when OFF):';
SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName
FROM dbo.Employees
WHERE ManagerID <> NULL;
GO

-- IS NULL / IS NOT NULL still works correctly regardless of ANSI_NULLS
PRINT 'ManagerID IS NULL (still works correctly):';
SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName
FROM dbo.Employees
WHERE ManagerID IS NULL;
GO

PRINT 'ManagerID IS NOT NULL (still works correctly):';
SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName
FROM dbo.Employees
WHERE ManagerID IS NOT NULL;
GO
```

**Output/Behavior with `SET ANSI_NULLS OFF`:**

* `WHERE ManagerID = NULL` will now **correctly return employees Alice and Charlie**. This is the non-standard behavior where `NULL = NULL` evaluates to `TRUE`.
* `WHERE ManagerID <> NULL` will return employee Bob.
* `WHERE ManagerID IS NULL` and `WHERE ManagerID IS NOT NULL` still function identically to when `ANSI_NULLS ON`. This highlights that `IS NULL` and `IS NOT NULL` are the reliable methods for checking for `NULL` regardless of the `ANSI_NULLS` setting.

**Example 3: Impact on Stored Procedure Creation**

This demonstrates the persistence of the `ANSI_NULLS` setting.

```sql
-- Create a procedure with SET ANSI_NULLS OFF
SET ANSI_NULLS OFF;
GO

CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.usp_GetNullManagers_NoAnsiNulls
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName
    FROM dbo.Employees
    WHERE ManagerID = NULL; -- This will work if created with ANSI_NULLS OFF
END;
GO

-- Create a procedure with SET ANSI_NULLS ON
SET ANSI_NULLS ON;
GO

CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.usp_GetNullManagers_WithAnsiNulls
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName
    FROM dbo.Employees
    WHERE ManagerID = NULL; -- This will NOT work (returns 0 rows) if created with ANSI_NULLS ON
END;
GO

-- Now, execute both procedures from a session where ANSI_NULLS is ON (default for SSMS)
SET ANSI_NULLS ON;
GO

PRINT '--- Executing usp_GetNullManagers_NoAnsiNulls (created with OFF) ---';
EXEC dbo.usp_GetNullManagers_NoAnsiNulls;
GO

PRINT '--- Executing usp_GetNullManagers_WithAnsiNulls (created with ON) ---';
EXEC dbo.usp_GetNullManagers_WithAnsiNulls;
GO

-- Cleanup
DROP PROCEDURE dbo.usp_GetNullManagers_NoAnsiNulls;
DROP PROCEDURE dbo.usp_GetNullManagers_WithAnsiNulls;
DROP TABLE dbo.Employees;
GO
```

**Observation:**

* `usp_GetNullManagers_NoAnsiNulls` (created with `ANSI_NULLS OFF`) will **return Alice and Charlie**. Its behavior is based on the `OFF` setting stored at creation.
* `usp_GetNullManagers_WithAnsiNulls` (created with `ANSI_NULLS ON`) will **return 0 rows**. Its behavior is based on the `ON` setting stored at creation.

This clearly demonstrates that the `ANSI_NULLS` setting is **persisted with the object definition**, not determined by the session's current setting when the object is executed. This is a crucial concept for understanding behavior consistency in your database objects.

### Recommendation

Always use `SET ANSI_NULLS ON;`

* It aligns with the SQL-92 standard, making your code more portable and predictable.
* It correctly models the behavior of `NULL` as an unknown value, preventing logical errors in comparisons.
* It's a mandatory requirement for many advanced SQL Server features like indexed views.
* It promotes consistent and reliable query results.

While `SET ANSI_NULLS OFF` exists for backward compatibility, it should be avoided in new development. Always use `IS NULL` or `IS NOT NULL` to check for the presence or absence of `NULL` values in your queries, as these constructs behave consistently regardless of the `ANSI_NULLS` setting.
