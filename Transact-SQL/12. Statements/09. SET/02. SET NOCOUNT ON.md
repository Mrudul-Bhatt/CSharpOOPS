Sure, let's dive deep into `SET NOCOUNT ON` in SQL Server (Transact-SQL).

### What `SET NOCOUNT ON` Does

When `SET NOCOUNT ON` is enabled for a session, it **prevents the sending of messages back to the client that indicate the number of rows affected by a Transact-SQL statement**.

By default, `NOCOUNT` is `OFF`. This means after every `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `MERGE` statement, or even some DDL statements, SQL Server sends a message similar to:

`(X rows affected)`

where `X` is the number of rows impacted by the statement.

When `SET NOCOUNT ON` is active, these messages are suppressed.

### Why `SET NOCOUNT ON` is Important (and Frequently Asked in Interviews)

1.  **Reduced Network Traffic:**
    * For every statement that affects rows, an additional network packet is sent from the SQL Server instance to the client application.
    * In scenarios with many small statements (e.g., inside loops, triggers, or frequently called stored procedures/functions), these `(X rows affected)` messages can accumulate significantly.
    * `SET NOCOUNT ON` eliminates this overhead, leading to less network traffic and potentially faster execution, especially over high-latency networks.

2.  **Improved Client Application Performance and Predictability:**
    * Many client-side database APIs (like ADO.NET, JDBC, ODBC) often have to process these row count messages.
    * If a stored procedure returns multiple result sets along with multiple `(X rows affected)` messages, some client drivers might struggle to differentiate between them or might incur overhead in parsing these messages.
    * `SET NOCOUNT ON` simplifies the communication, ensuring that only actual data result sets or explicit `PRINT` messages are returned, which can make client-side coding cleaner and reduce processing overhead.
    * It prevents client applications from receiving unexpected row count messages that might interfere with their logic, especially when they are only expecting a single result set or output parameters.

3.  **Best Practice for Stored Procedures, Functions, and Triggers:**
    * It's widely considered a best practice to include `SET NOCOUNT ON` at the beginning of virtually all stored procedures, user-defined functions, and triggers.
    * In triggers, for instance, an `INSERT` statement into the base table would normally produce `(1 row affected)` (if one row was inserted). If the trigger then performs another `UPDATE`, that's another `(1 row affected)`. This can confuse the calling application, which might only expect one `(X rows affected)` message from its initial `INSERT` statement. `SET NOCOUNT ON` avoids this ambiguity.

4.  **No Impact on `@ROWCOUNT`:**
    * It's crucial to understand that `SET NOCOUNT ON` **does not affect the `@@ROWCOUNT` system function**.
    * `@@ROWCOUNT` still accurately reflects the number of rows affected by the immediately preceding statement, regardless of the `NOCOUNT` setting. This allows your server-side T-SQL logic to still query the number of affected rows for conditional logic or logging.

### Code Examples

Let's demonstrate the effect of `SET NOCOUNT ON`.

**Scenario 1: Simple SELECT Statement**

```sql
-- Example 1: SET NOCOUNT OFF (Default Behavior)
PRINT '--- SET NOCOUNT OFF ---';
SET NOCOUNT OFF; -- Explicitly turn it off, though it's the default
SELECT TOP 3 * FROM sys.objects;
GO

-- Example 2: SET NOCOUNT ON
PRINT '--- SET NOCOUNT ON ---';
SET NOCOUNT ON;
SELECT TOP 3 * FROM sys.objects;
GO
```

**Observation:**

* When `SET NOCOUNT OFF`, you will see something like:
    ```
    --- SET NOCOUNT OFF ---
    (3 rows affected)
    ```
  followed by the actual data.
* When `SET NOCOUNT ON`, you will only see:
    ```
    --- SET NOCOUNT ON ---
    ```
  followed by the actual data. The `(3 rows affected)` message is suppressed.

**Scenario 2: Inside a Stored Procedure**

Let's create a stored procedure that performs an `INSERT` and an `UPDATE`.

```sql
-- Create a test table
IF OBJECT_ID('dbo.TestLog', 'U') IS NOT NULL
DROP TABLE dbo.TestLog;

CREATE TABLE dbo.TestLog (
    LogID INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
    MessageText NVARCHAR(255),
    CreatedDate DATETIME DEFAULT GETDATE()
);
GO

-- Stored Procedure without SET NOCOUNT ON
CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.usp_ProcessLog_NoNoCount
    @inputMessage NVARCHAR(255)
AS
BEGIN
    -- No SET NOCOUNT ON here
    INSERT INTO dbo.TestLog (MessageText) VALUES (@inputMessage);
    UPDATE dbo.TestLog SET MessageText = @inputMessage + ' (Processed)' WHERE LogID = SCOPE_IDENTITY();
END;
GO

-- Stored Procedure with SET NOCOUNT ON
CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.usp_ProcessLog_WithNoCount
    @inputMessage NVARCHAR(255)
AS
BEGIN
    SET NOCOUNT ON; -- Crucial line
    INSERT INTO dbo.TestLog (MessageText) VALUES (@inputMessage);
    UPDATE dbo.TestLog SET MessageText = @inputMessage + ' (Processed)' WHERE LogID = SCOPE_IDENTITY();
END;
GO

-- Execute and observe the output
PRINT '--- Executing usp_ProcessLog_NoNoCount ---';
EXEC dbo.usp_ProcessLog_NoNoCount 'First log entry';
GO

PRINT '--- Executing usp_ProcessLog_WithNoCount ---';
EXEC dbo.usp_ProcessLog_WithNoCount 'Second log entry';
GO

-- Clean up
DROP PROCEDURE dbo.usp_ProcessLog_NoNoCount;
DROP PROCEDURE dbo.usp_ProcessLog_WithNoCount;
DROP TABLE dbo.TestLog;
GO
```

**Observation:**

* When executing `dbo.usp_ProcessLog_NoNoCount`, you will see:
    ```
    --- Executing usp_ProcessLog_NoNoCount ---
    (1 row affected)
    (1 row affected)
    ```
  This indicates that both the `INSERT` and `UPDATE` statements within the procedure sent their own row count messages. A client application might misinterpret this as two separate operations when it was called as one procedure.
* When executing `dbo.usp_ProcessLog_WithNoCount`, you will only see:
    ```
    --- Executing usp_ProcessLog_WithNoCount ---
    ```
  No row count messages are returned from the stored procedure itself, which is typically the desired behavior for a clean client-side interaction.

**Scenario 3: Using `@@ROWCOUNT` with `SET NOCOUNT ON`**

This demonstrates that `SET NOCOUNT ON` does *not* affect `@@ROWCOUNT`.

```sql
SET NOCOUNT ON;

PRINT 'Starting test for @@ROWCOUNT...';

-- Perform an INSERT
INSERT INTO dbo.TestLog (MessageText) VALUES ('Test @@ROWCOUNT');
PRINT 'Rows affected by INSERT: ' + CAST(@@ROWCOUNT AS NVARCHAR(10));

-- Perform an UPDATE
UPDATE dbo.TestLog SET MessageText = 'Updated message' WHERE LogID = SCOPE_IDENTITY();
PRINT 'Rows affected by UPDATE: ' + CAST(@@ROWCOUNT AS NVARCHAR(10));

-- Perform a SELECT
SELECT * FROM dbo.TestLog WHERE 1 = 0; -- Selects 0 rows
PRINT 'Rows affected by SELECT (0 rows): ' + CAST(@@ROWCOUNT AS NVARCHAR(10));

SELECT * FROM dbo.TestLog; -- Selects all rows (let's assume 2)
PRINT 'Rows affected by SELECT (all rows): ' + CAST(@@ROWCOUNT AS NVARCHAR(10));

PRINT 'Test for @@ROWCOUNT completed.';
```

**Observation:**

Even though `SET NOCOUNT ON` is active, the `PRINT` statements correctly report the `@@ROWCOUNT` for each preceding statement. This confirms that `SET NOCOUNT ON` only affects the *messages sent to the client*, not the internal tracking of affected rows by SQL Server.

### When NOT to Use `SET NOCOUNT ON`

There are very few scenarios where you would *not* want to use `SET NOCOUNT ON` in stored procedures, functions, or triggers. The main exception is if your client application **specifically relies on the `(X rows affected)` messages for its internal logic**. This is rare in modern development but can sometimes be found in legacy applications.

### Conclusion

`SET NOCOUNT ON` is a simple yet powerful `SET` option that is fundamental for writing efficient and predictable Transact-SQL code, especially when building stored procedures and interacting with client applications. Always aim to include it at the beginning of your stored procedures, functions, and triggers as a standard best practice.
