Let's continue our deep dive into `DROP` statements in SQL Server, focusing on key components of its encryption hierarchy and performance optimization.

---

### 1. `DROP CERTIFICATE`, `DROP ASYMMETRIC KEY`, `DROP SYMMETRIC KEY` - Deep Dive

These commands are fundamental to SQL Server's encryption capabilities, forming the core of its cryptographic hierarchy. They are used to manage the keys and certificates that encrypt sensitive data at various levels.

#### Understanding the Encryption Hierarchy

SQL Server's encryption hierarchy is layered:

* **Service Master Key (SMK):** Server-level, automatically created. Protects server-level certificates, credentials, and the Database Master Key. (Cannot be directly dropped, but can be regenerated).
* **Database Master Key (DMK):** Database-level. Protects database-level certificates, asymmetric keys, and symmetric keys.
* **Certificates / Asymmetric Keys:** Used to protect symmetric keys, encrypt data, or sign code/data.
* **Symmetric Keys:** The most common type of key for bulk data encryption due to their speed.

#### `DROP CERTIFICATE`

**Purpose and Importance:**

* **Remove Cryptographic Identity:** Certificates are digital identities used for authentication, encryption, and signing. Dropping them removes this identity.
* **Security Lifecycle:** Part of key rotation policies or decommissioning applications that used the certificate.
* **Cleanup:** Removes old or unused certificates.

**Prerequisites and Considerations:**

1.  **Permissions:** Requires `CONTROL` permission on the certificate, `ALTER ANY CERTIFICATE` permission, or `CONTROL SERVER` permission.
2.  **Dependencies:**
    * **Encrypted by the Certificate:** You **cannot drop a certificate if it has encrypted any symmetric keys or database encryption keys (TDE DEK).** These dependent keys must be dropped or re-encrypted first.
    * **Signatures:** If the certificate was used to sign stored procedures, functions, assemblies, or other modules, dropping it will invalidate those signatures, potentially impacting execution (e.g., if execution was dependent on permissions granted via the signature).
    * **Endpoints/Service Broker:** If the certificate is used by service broker endpoints or for connections, dropping it will break that communication.
    * **Login Mapping:** If a login is mapped to a certificate, dropping the certificate will orphan the login (unless the login is re-mapped).
    * **Always Encrypted (CMK Protection):** If a Column Master Key (CMK) is encrypted by this certificate, you cannot drop the certificate. The CMK must be dropped or re-encrypted first.
3.  **Backup:** It is **CRITICAL** to back up the certificate (with its private key if used for encryption/signing) to a file before dropping it, especially if any data remains encrypted by it, or if signed modules need to be re-signed later.
4.  **Transaction Context:** DDL operation, can be in a transaction.

**Syntax:**

```sql
DROP CERTIFICATE [ IF EXISTS ] certificate_name [ ; ]
```

* `IF EXISTS`: (SQL Server 2016+) Prevents error if the certificate does not exist.

#### `DROP ASYMMETRIC KEY`

**Purpose and Importance:**

* **Remove Public/Private Key Pair:** Asymmetric keys (RSA, ECC) are used for encryption (public key) and decryption (private key), or for signing (private key) and verification (public key). Dropping it removes the key pair.
* **Security Lifecycle:** Part of key rotation.
* **Cleanup:** Removes old or unused asymmetric keys.

**Prerequisites and Considerations:**

1.  **Permissions:** Requires `CONTROL` permission on the asymmetric key, `ALTER ANY ASYMMETRIC KEY` permission, or `CONTROL SERVER` permission.
2.  **Dependencies:**
    * **Encrypted by the Asymmetric Key:** You **cannot drop an asymmetric key if it has encrypted any symmetric keys or database encryption keys (TDE DEK).** Dependent keys must be dropped or re-encrypted.
    * **Signatures:** If the asymmetric key was used to sign modules, dropping it will invalidate those signatures.
    * **Login Mapping:** If a login is mapped to an asymmetric key, dropping the key will orphan the login.
    * **Column Master Key (CMK Protection):** If a CMK is encrypted by this asymmetric key, you cannot drop the asymmetric key. The CMK must be dropped or re-encrypted first.
3.  **Backup:** **CRITICAL** to back up the asymmetric key to a file (especially with private key) if any data remains encrypted or signed by it.
4.  **Transaction Context:** DDL operation, can be in a transaction.

**Syntax:**

```sql
DROP ASYMMETRIC KEY [ IF EXISTS ] key_name [ ; ]
```

* `IF EXISTS`: (SQL Server 2016+) Prevents error if the key does not exist.

#### `DROP SYMMETRIC KEY`

**Purpose and Importance:**

* **Remove Bulk Encryption Key:** Symmetric keys are the workhorses for encrypting large amounts of data. Dropping them means data encrypted by this key can no longer be decrypted using this key.
* **Data Decryption:** Usually, data encrypted by a symmetric key is decrypted *before* the key is dropped, unless the key is being rotated and re-encrypted.
* **Security Lifecycle:** Part of key rotation.
* **Cleanup:** Removes old or unused symmetric keys.

**Prerequisites and Considerations:**

1.  **Permissions:** Requires `CONTROL` permission on the symmetric key, `ALTER ANY SYMMETRIC KEY` permission, or `CONTROL SERVER` permission.
2.  **Dependencies:**
    * **Encrypted Columns/Data:** You **cannot drop a symmetric key if it is currently encrypting data in a column** (e.g., using `ENCRYPTBYKEY`). You must decrypt the data first.
    * **Backup:** **CRITICAL** to back up the symmetric key to a file if you intend to recover data encrypted by it later.
3.  **Transaction Context:** DDL operation, can be in a transaction.

**Syntax:**

```sql
DROP SYMMETRIC KEY [ IF EXISTS ] key_name [ ; ]
```

* `IF EXISTS`: (SQL Server 2016+) Prevents error if the key does not exist.

#### Code Examples for Encryption Key Management

**Setup:**

```sql
USE master;
GO

IF DB_ID('EncryptionHierarchyDemoDB') IS NOT NULL DROP DATABASE EncryptionHierarchyDemoDB;
CREATE DATABASE EncryptionHierarchyDemoDB;
GO
USE EncryptionHierarchyDemoDB;
GO

PRINT 'EncryptionHierarchyDemoDB created.';

-- Create Database Master Key (DMK) - required for certificates and keys
CREATE MASTER KEY ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD = 'MyStrongDMKPassword!1';
GO
PRINT 'Database Master Key created.';

-- Create a table with an encrypted column (for symmetric key demo)
CREATE TABLE EncryptedData (
    ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    SensitiveInfo VARBINARY(MAX)
);
GO
PRINT 'EncryptedData table created.';
```

**Example 1: Dropping a Symmetric Key (after decrypting data)**

```sql
USE EncryptionHierarchyDemoDB;
GO

PRINT '--- Example 1: Dropping a Symmetric Key ---';

-- Create a Symmetric Key, protected by DMK
CREATE SYMMETRIC KEY SymKey_ConfidentialData
WITH ALGORITHM = AES_256
ENCRYPTION BY MASTER KEY;
GO
PRINT 'Symmetric Key SymKey_ConfidentialData created.';

-- Open the Master Key (needed to use keys protected by it)
OPEN MASTER KEY DECRYPTION BY PASSWORD = 'MyStrongDMKPassword!1';
GO

-- Insert encrypted data
INSERT INTO EncryptedData (ID, SensitiveInfo)
VALUES (1, ENCRYPTBYKEY(KEY_GUID('SymKey_ConfidentialData'), CONVERT(VARBINARY(MAX), 'This is very secret!')));
GO

SELECT 'Encrypted data inserted:' AS Stage, ID, SensitiveInfo FROM EncryptedData;
GO

-- Attempt to drop Symmetric Key (will fail because it's encrypting data)
-- DROP SYMMETRIC KEY SymKey_ConfidentialData;
-- GO
-- Error: "Cannot drop symmetric key 'SymKey_ConfidentialData' because it is in use by objects in the database."

PRINT 'Attempting to drop SymKey_ConfidentialData (will fail due to encrypted data).';

-- To drop, first decrypt the data (or truncate/delete the table)
UPDATE EncryptedData
SET SensitiveInfo = DECRYPTBYKEY(SensitiveInfo)
WHERE ID = 1;
GO

PRINT 'Data decrypted.';

SELECT 'Data after decryption:' AS Stage, ID, CONVERT(NVARCHAR(MAX), SensitiveInfo) AS DecryptedInfo FROM EncryptedData;
GO

-- Now drop the symmetric key
DROP SYMMETRIC KEY SymKey_ConfidentialData;
GO
PRINT 'Symmetric Key SymKey_ConfidentialData dropped.';

-- Close the Master Key (good practice)
CLOSE MASTER KEY;
GO
```

**Example 2: Dropping a Certificate (after ensuring no dependencies)**

```sql
USE EncryptionHierarchyDemoDB;
GO

PRINT '--- Example 2: Dropping a Certificate ---';

-- Create a Certificate, protected by DMK by default
CREATE CERTIFICATE Cert_ForSigning WITH SUBJECT = 'Certificate for signing modules';
GO
PRINT 'Certificate Cert_ForSigning created.';

-- Verify certificate exists
SELECT name, pvt_key_encryption_type_desc FROM sys.certificates WHERE name = 'Cert_ForSigning';
GO

-- Drop the certificate
DROP CERTIFICATE Cert_ForSigning;
GO
PRINT 'Certificate Cert_ForSigning dropped.';

-- Verify it's gone
SELECT name FROM sys.certificates WHERE name = 'Cert_ForSigning';
GO
```

**Example 3: Dropping an Asymmetric Key (with and without IF EXISTS)**

```sql
USE EncryptionHierarchyDemoDB;
GO

PRINT '--- Example 3: Dropping an Asymmetric Key ---';

-- Create an Asymmetric Key, protected by DMK by default
CREATE ASYMMETRIC KEY AsymKey_ExternalEncryption WITH ALGORITHM = RSA_2048;
GO
PRINT 'Asymmetric Key AsymKey_ExternalEncryption created.';

-- Drop it using IF EXISTS
DROP ASYMMETRIC KEY IF EXISTS AsymKey_ExternalEncryption;
GO
PRINT 'Asymmetric Key AsymKey_ExternalEncryption dropped (or ignored if not found).';

-- Example of dropping a non-existent key with IF EXISTS (no error)
DROP ASYMMETRIC KEY IF EXISTS NonExistentAsymmetricKey;
GO
PRINT 'NonExistentAsymmetricKey (if it existed) dropped, or ignored.';
```

**Cleanup:**

```sql
USE master;
GO

DROP DATABASE EncryptionHierarchyDemoDB;
GO
PRINT 'EncryptionHierarchyDemoDB cleaned up.';
```

### 2. `DROP COLUMN MASTER KEY` / `DROP COLUMN ENCRYPTION KEY` - Deep Dive

These commands are specific to the **Always Encrypted** feature in SQL Server, which provides client-side encryption of sensitive data.

#### Understanding Always Encrypted Keys

* **Column Master Key (CMK):** This is the root key for Always Encrypted. It's stored outside SQL Server (e.g., in Windows Certificate Store, Azure Key Vault, Hardware Security Module) and only its metadata (name, key path, key store provider) is stored in the database. The CMK is used to encrypt Column Encryption Keys (CEKs).
* **Column Encryption Key (CEK):** This key is used to encrypt the actual data in your columns. Each CEK is encrypted multiple times, once for each CMK that can decrypt it. The CEK is stored *inside* the database as part of the column definition.

#### `DROP COLUMN MASTER KEY`

**Purpose and Importance:**

* **Remove Always Encrypted Root:** Removes the metadata for a Column Master Key from the database.
* **Key Rotation/Decommissioning:** Part of the lifecycle management for Always Encrypted keys.

**Prerequisites and Considerations:**

1.  **Permissions:** Requires `ALTER ANY COLUMN MASTER KEY` permission or `CONTROL` permission on the database.
2.  **Dependencies:** You **cannot drop a CMK if any Column Encryption Key (CEK) is encrypted by it.** All CEKs encrypted by the CMK must be dropped or re-encrypted to be protected by a different CMK first.
3.  **Data Inaccessibility:** Dropping a CMK without first re-encrypting or decrypting all data columns encrypted by associated CEKs will render that data permanently inaccessible.
4.  **External Key Store:** Remember that the actual CMK (the cryptographic key itself) is stored externally. Dropping the CMK metadata in SQL Server does not remove the key from the external store (e.g., certificate from Windows store). You must manage that separately.
5.  **Transaction Context:** DDL operation, can be in a transaction.

**Syntax:**

```sql
DROP COLUMN MASTER KEY [ IF EXISTS ] key_name [ ; ]
```

* `IF EXISTS`: (SQL Server 2016+) Prevents error if the CMK does not exist.

#### `DROP COLUMN ENCRYPTION KEY`

**Purpose and Importance:**

* **Remove Column Encryption Key:** Removes a CEK from the database.
* **Data Decryption:** Usually, data encrypted by a CEK is decrypted *before* the CEK is dropped.
* **Key Rotation/Decommissioning:** Part of the lifecycle management for Always Encrypted keys.

**Prerequisites and Considerations:**

1.  **Permissions:** Requires `ALTER ANY COLUMN ENCRYPTION KEY` permission or `CONTROL` permission on the database.
2.  **Dependencies:** You **cannot drop a CEK if any column in the database is encrypted with it.** All columns encrypted by the CEK must first be decrypted (or re-encrypted with a different CEK) using the Always Encrypted wizard or `ALTER TABLE ... ALTER COLUMN` with `ENCRYPTED WITH` options.
3.  **Data Inaccessibility:** Dropping a CEK without first decrypting the associated columns will render that data permanently inaccessible.
4.  **Transaction Context:** DDL operation, can be in a transaction.

**Syntax:**

```sql
DROP COLUMN ENCRYPTION KEY [ IF EXISTS ] key_name [ ; ]
```

* `IF EXISTS`: (SQL Server 2016+) Prevents error if the CEK does not exist.

#### Code Examples for Always Encrypted Keys

*(Note: Always Encrypted features require a specific client driver and configuration. The following code demonstrates the server-side DDL. Actual data encryption/decryption is typically managed by client applications or SSMS wizard.)*

**Setup:**

```sql
USE master;
GO

IF DB_ID('AlwaysEncryptedDemoDB') IS NOT NULL DROP DATABASE AlwaysEncryptedDemoDB;
CREATE DATABASE AlwaysEncryptedDemoDB;
GO
USE AlwaysEncryptedDemoDB;
GO

PRINT 'AlwaysEncryptedDemoDB created.';

-- Create a dummy Master Key (needed for certificate protection if using cert-based CMK)
CREATE MASTER KEY ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD = 'AE_DMK_Password!1';
GO
-- Create a Certificate (simulating a cert-based CMK)
CREATE CERTIFICATE AECert WITH SUBJECT = 'Always Encrypted CMK Certificate';
GO
PRINT 'DMK and Certificate created (for CMK protection).';

-- Create Column Master Key (metadata only)
-- In a real scenario, the ENCRYPTED BY part would point to an actual certificate store or HSM path.
-- For this demo, we'll use a placeholder for ENCRYPTED_VALUE as the actual encryption is client-side.
CREATE COLUMN MASTER KEY MyCMK
WITH (
    KEY_STORE_PROVIDER_NAME = 'MSSQL_CERTIFICATE_STORE',
    KEY_PATH = 'CertForAE' -- Placeholder for actual cert path or key vault reference
);
GO
PRINT 'Column Master Key MyCMK created (metadata).';

-- Create a Column Encryption Key (encrypted by CMK)
CREATE COLUMN ENCRYPTION KEY MyCEK
WITH VALUES (
    COLUMN_MASTER_KEY = MyCMK,
    ALGORITHM = 'AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA256',
    ENCRYPTED_VALUE = 0x0123456789ABCDEF -- Placeholder for actual encrypted key material
);
GO
PRINT 'Column Encryption Key MyCEK created (encrypted by MyCMK).';

-- Create a table with an encrypted column (conceptually)
CREATE TABLE SensitiveData (
    ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    EncryptedSSN VARBINARY(128) ENCRYPTED WITH (COLUMN_ENCRYPTION_KEY = MyCEK, ENCRYPTION_TYPE = DETERMINISTIC, ALGORITHM = 'AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA256')
);
GO
PRINT 'SensitiveData table with encrypted column (conceptually) created.';
```

**Example 1: Dropping a Column Encryption Key (Will Fail if column dependent)**

```sql
USE AlwaysEncryptedDemoDB;
GO

PRINT '--- Example 1: Dropping a Column Encryption Key ---';

-- Attempt to drop the CEK (will fail because SensitiveData.EncryptedSSN uses it)
-- DROP COLUMN ENCRYPTION KEY MyCEK;
-- GO
-- Error: "Cannot drop the column encryption key 'MyCEK' because it is encrypting column 'EncryptedSSN' in table 'SensitiveData'."

PRINT 'Attempting to drop MyCEK (will fail due to column dependency).';

-- To successfully drop the CEK, you must first modify the column to be unencrypted (or encrypted with another CEK)
-- This is typically done via the Always Encrypted wizard in SSMS or client-side tools.
-- Example of conceptual DDL (won't actually decrypt data here without client connection):
ALTER TABLE SensitiveData ALTER COLUMN EncryptedSSN VARBINARY(128) NOT NULL; -- Removes encryption
-- In a real scenario, you would run a PowerShell script or SSMS wizard to decrypt data.

PRINT 'Conceputal decryption of column EncryptedSSN.';

-- Now drop the CEK
DROP COLUMN ENCRYPTION KEY MyCEK;
GO
PRINT 'Column Encryption Key MyCEK dropped.';
```

**Example 2: Dropping a Column Master Key (Will Fail if CEK dependent)**

```sql
USE AlwaysEncryptedDemoDB;
GO

PRINT '--- Example 2: Dropping a Column Master Key ---';

-- Re-create a CEK for this demo (as it was dropped in previous example)
CREATE COLUMN ENCRYPTION KEY MyCEK_New
WITH VALUES (
    COLUMN_MASTER_KEY = MyCMK,
    ALGORITHM = 'AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA256',
    ENCRYPTED_VALUE = 0xABCDEF0123456789 -- Placeholder
);
GO
PRINT 'MyCEK_New created (encrypted by MyCMK).';

-- Attempt to drop the CMK (will fail because MyCEK_New is encrypted by it)
-- DROP COLUMN MASTER KEY MyCMK;
-- GO
-- Error: "Cannot drop column master key 'MyCMK' because it is encrypting column encryption key(s)."

PRINT 'Attempting to drop MyCMK (will fail due to CEK dependency).';

-- To successfully drop the CMK, you must first drop the dependent CEK(s)
DROP COLUMN ENCRYPTION KEY MyCEK_New;
GO
PRINT 'Column Encryption Key MyCEK_New dropped.';

-- Now drop the CMK
DROP COLUMN MASTER KEY MyCMK;
GO
PRINT 'Column Master Key MyCMK dropped.';
```

**Cleanup:**

```sql
USE master;
GO

DROP DATABASE AlwaysEncryptedDemoDB;
GO
-- Drop the certificate
DROP CERTIFICATE AECert;
GO
-- Drop the DMK
DROP MASTER KEY;
GO

PRINT 'AlwaysEncryptedDemoDB and associated keys/certificate cleaned up.';
```

### 3. `DROP STATISTICS` - Deep Dive

The `DROP STATISTICS` statement is used to remove user-defined statistics from a table or indexed view. Statistics objects contain information about the data distribution in one or more columns of a table or indexed view. The SQL Server Query Optimizer uses these statistics to estimate the cardinality (number of rows) of query results, which helps it choose the most efficient execution plan.

#### Purpose and Importance

* **Performance Tuning:** Statistics are critical for the Query Optimizer. Dropping them can significantly impact query performance.
* **Troubleshooting:** Sometimes, corrupted or outdated statistics can lead to poor query plans. Dropping and recreating them can be a troubleshooting step.
* **Cleanup:** Removing old, redundant, or manually created statistics that are no longer needed.
* **Automatic vs. Manual:** SQL Server typically creates and updates statistics automatically. `DROP STATISTICS` is usually applied to *user-defined* (manual) statistics, or for specific troubleshooting of automatically created ones.

#### Prerequisites and Considerations

1.  **Permissions:** Requires `ALTER` permission on the table or view, or `db_owner` fixed database role membership.
2.  **Impact on Query Plans:** Dropping statistics will cause the Query Optimizer to no longer use that specific statistics object. This will likely lead to the creation of new, automatically generated statistics (if `AUTO_CREATE_STATISTICS` is ON for the database) or less optimal query plans if no suitable statistics exist.
3.  **Automatic Re-creation:** If `AUTO_CREATE_STATISTICS` is `ON` for the database (which is the default and recommended setting), SQL Server will often re-create statistics on the columns if queries on them become frequent and optimal statistics are missing.
4.  **`NORECOMPUTE`:** When creating statistics, the `NORECOMPUTE` option prevents automatic updates. If you drop such statistics, they won't automatically re-create and update, unless `AUTO_CREATE_STATISTICS` is ON and the optimizer deems it necessary.
5.  **Index-Created Statistics:** You cannot directly drop statistics that are implicitly created when an index is created. To remove those, you must drop the index itself.
6.  **Transaction Context:** DDL operation, can be in a transaction.

#### Syntax

```sql
DROP STATISTICS [ IF EXISTS ] { table_or_indexed_view_name.statistics_name } [ ,...n ]
[ ; ]
```

* `IF EXISTS`: (SQL Server 2016+) Prevents error if the statistics object does not exist.

#### Code Examples for `DROP STATISTICS`

**Setup:**

```sql
USE tempdb;
GO

IF OBJECT_ID('dbo.Products', 'U') IS NOT NULL DROP TABLE dbo.Products;
CREATE TABLE Products (
    ProductID INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
    ProductName NVARCHAR(200),
    Category NVARCHAR(50),
    Price DECIMAL(10,2)
);
GO

-- Insert some dummy data
INSERT INTO Products (ProductName, Category, Price)
VALUES
('Laptop', 'Electronics', 1200.00),
('Mouse', 'Electronics', 25.00),
('Keyboard', 'Electronics', 75.00),
('Desk Chair', 'Furniture', 250.00),
('Table', 'Furniture', 150.00),
('Monitor', 'Electronics', 300.00),
('Headphones', 'Electronics', 100.00);
GO

PRINT 'Products table created and populated.';
```

**Example 1: Basic `DROP STATISTICS` (User-Defined)**

```sql
USE tempdb;
GO

PRINT '--- Example 1: Basic DROP STATISTICS (User-Defined) ---';

-- Create a user-defined statistic on the Category column
CREATE STATISTICS Stat_Products_Category
ON Products (Category);
GO

PRINT 'User-defined statistic Stat_Products_Category created.';

-- Verify the statistic exists
SELECT name, object_id, stats_id, auto_created, user_created
FROM sys.stats
WHERE object_id = OBJECT_ID('Products') AND name = 'Stat_Products_Category';
GO

-- Now, drop the user-defined statistic
DROP STATISTICS Products.Stat_Products_Category;
GO

PRINT 'Statistic Stat_Products_Category dropped.';

-- Verify it's gone
SELECT name FROM sys.stats WHERE object_id = OBJECT_ID('Products') AND name = 'Stat_Products_Category';
-- Expected: No rows
GO
```

**Example 2: Dropping an Index-Created Statistic (Will Fail)**

```sql
USE tempdb;
GO

PRINT '--- Example 2: Dropping an Index-Created Statistic (Will Fail) ---';

-- Create a non-clustered index on ProductName (this automatically creates a statistic)
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IX_Products_ProductName
ON Products (ProductName);
GO
PRINT 'Index IX_Products_ProductName created.';

-- Find the automatically created statistic associated with the index
SELECT name AS StatisticName, object_id, stats_id, auto_created, user_created, no_recompute
FROM sys.stats
WHERE object_id = OBJECT_ID('Products')
  AND index_id = INDEXPROPERTY(OBJECT_ID('Products'), 'IX_Products_ProductName', 'IndexId');
-- The name will usually be the same as the index name.

-- Attempt to drop the statistic associated with the index (this will fail)
-- DROP STATISTICS Products.IX_Products_ProductName; -- Replace with actual statistic name if different
-- GO
-- Error: "Cannot drop the statistics 'IX_Products_ProductName', because it is being used by an index."

PRINT 'Attempting to drop index-created statistic (will fail).';

-- To remove this statistic, you must drop the index itself
DROP INDEX IX_Products_ProductName ON Products;
GO
PRINT 'Index IX_Products_ProductName dropped. Its associated statistic is also gone.';
```

**Example 3: `DROP STATISTICS IF EXISTS`**

```sql
USE tempdb;
GO

PRINT '--- Example 3: DROP STATISTICS IF EXISTS ---';

-- This will not cause an error if NonExistentStat does not exist
DROP STATISTICS IF EXISTS Products.NonExistentStat;
GO

-- Create a dummy statistic
CREATE STATISTICS DummyStat ON Products (Category);
GO

-- Drop it using IF EXISTS
DROP STATISTICS IF EXISTS Products.DummyStat;
GO

PRINT 'NonExistentStat or DummyStat dropped (or ignored if not found).';
```

**Cleanup:**

```sql
USE tempdb;
GO
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Products;
GO
PRINT 'Products table cleaned up.';
```

These `DROP` commands are integral to managing SQL Server's encryption and performance characteristics. While less about immediate data loss (except for the impact on decryption), their misuse can lead to security vulnerabilities, data inaccessibility, or significant performance degradation. Always understand the dependencies and implications before executing them in a production environment.
