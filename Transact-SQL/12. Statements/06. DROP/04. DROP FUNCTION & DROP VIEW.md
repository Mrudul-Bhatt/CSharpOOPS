Let's continue our deep dive into `DROP` statements in Transact-SQL by examining `DROP FUNCTION` and `DROP VIEW`. These commands are essential for managing database logic and presentation layers.

### `DROP FUNCTION` - Deep Dive

The `DROP FUNCTION` statement is used to remove a user-defined function (UDF) from the current database. User-defined functions are routines that accept parameters, perform an action (often a complex calculation or data manipulation), and return a value (either a single scalar value or a table).

#### Purpose and Importance

* **Schema Cleanup:** Removes obsolete or unused user-defined functions, keeping the database schema tidy.
* **Refactoring:** Part of updating or restructuring database logic, replacing old function implementations with new ones.
* **Performance Tuning:** Sometimes, poorly performing UDFs are replaced with more efficient alternatives (e.g., inlined table-valued functions or refactored T-SQL code), necessitating the removal of the old function.
* **Deployment:** Used in deployment scripts to ensure old versions of functions are removed before new ones are created.

#### Types of User-Defined Functions

Before dropping, it's useful to recall the types of UDFs:

1.  **Scalar Functions:** Return a single data value.
2.  **Table-Valued Functions (TVFs):**
    * **Inline Table-Valued Functions (iTVFs):** Return a table data type, and their definition is similar to a parameterized view. They are often "inlined" into the calling query, meaning the optimizer treats them like a derived table, which can lead to better performance.
    * **Multi-Statement Table-Valued Functions (mTVFs):** Return a table data type, but involve multiple T-SQL statements within their body to build the result set. These are generally less performant than iTVFs as they behave more like black boxes to the optimizer.

#### Prerequisites and Considerations

1.  **Permissions:** You need `CONTROL` permission on the function, `ALTER` permission on the schema to which the function belongs, or `ALTER ANY FUNCTION` permission. Members of `db_ddladmin` or `db_owner` fixed database roles can drop functions.
2.  **Dependencies:** This is the most critical consideration for `DROP FUNCTION`.
    * **Calling Objects:** If other database objects (e.g., views, stored procedures, other functions, computed columns, check constraints, default constraints, or even other tables with `DEFAULT` or `CHECK` constraints that use the function) reference the function you are dropping, `DROP FUNCTION` will **fail** if the dependent object is schema-bound.
    * **Schema-Bound Functions:** Functions created with the `SCHEMABINDING` option prevent the dropping of underlying objects (like tables) that they reference. Similarly, you cannot drop a function if it's schema-bound to a computed column, `CHECK` constraint, or `DEFAULT` constraint that uses it.
    * **Non-Schema-Bound Functions:** If a function is *not* schema-bound, you *can* drop it, but any objects that call it will become invalid and fail at runtime. SQL Server will issue warnings in the execution plan for dependent objects.
    * **`sys.sql_expression_dependencies`:** This system view is crucial for checking dependencies before dropping.
3.  **Functionality Impact:** Dropping a function immediately removes its executable logic, affecting any applications or processes that rely on it.
4.  **Transaction Context:** `DROP FUNCTION` can be executed within a transaction, allowing for `ROLLBACK` if something goes wrong.

#### Syntax

```sql
DROP FUNCTION [ IF EXISTS ] { [ schema_name. ] function_name } [ ,...n ]
[ ; ]
```

* `IF EXISTS`: (SQL Server 2016+) Prevents an error if the function does not exist.

#### Code Examples

**Setup:**

```sql
USE tempdb;
GO

-- Clean up existing objects from previous runs if any
IF OBJECT_ID('dbo.Customers', 'U') IS NOT NULL DROP TABLE dbo.Customers;
IF OBJECT_ID('dbo.CalculateAge', 'FN') IS NOT NULL DROP FUNCTION dbo.CalculateAge;
IF OBJECT_ID('dbo.GetCustomersByCity', 'IF') IS NOT NULL DROP FUNCTION dbo.GetCustomersByCity;
IF OBJECT_ID('dbo.GetCustomerSummary', 'TF') IS NOT NULL DROP FUNCTION dbo.GetCustomerSummary;
IF OBJECT_ID('dbo.Orders', 'U') IS NOT NULL DROP TABLE dbo.Orders;
GO

-- Create a dummy table for functions to interact with
CREATE TABLE Customers (
    CustomerID INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1,1),
    FirstName NVARCHAR(50),
    LastName NVARCHAR(50),
    DateOfBirth DATE,
    City NVARCHAR(50)
);

INSERT INTO Customers (FirstName, LastName, DateOfBirth, City) VALUES
('Alice', 'Smith', '1990-05-15', 'New York'),
('Bob', 'Johnson', '1985-11-20', 'London'),
('Charlie', 'Brown', '1992-03-01', 'New York');
GO

PRINT 'Customers table created.';
```

**Example 1: Dropping a Scalar Function**

```sql
PRINT '--- Example 1: Dropping a Scalar Function ---';

-- Create a scalar function
CREATE FUNCTION dbo.CalculateAge (@DOB DATE)
RETURNS INT
AS
BEGIN
    RETURN DATEDIFF(year, @DOB, GETDATE()) -
           CASE WHEN MONTH(@DOB) > MONTH(GETDATE()) OR
                     (MONTH(@DOB) = MONTH(GETDATE()) AND DAY(@DOB) > DAY(GETDATE()))
                THEN 1
                ELSE 0
           END;
END;
GO

PRINT 'Function dbo.CalculateAge created.';

-- Test the function
SELECT CustomerID, FirstName, dbo.CalculateAge(DateOfBirth) AS Age FROM Customers;
GO

-- Now, drop the function
DROP FUNCTION dbo.CalculateAge;
GO

PRINT 'Function dbo.CalculateAge dropped.';

-- Attempting to use it will now fail
-- SELECT CustomerID, FirstName, dbo.CalculateAge(DateOfBirth) AS Age FROM Customers;
-- Error: "Could not find function 'dbo.CalculateAge'."
GO
```

**Example 2: Dropping an Inline Table-Valued Function (iTVF)**

```sql
PRINT '--- Example 2: Dropping an Inline Table-Valued Function ---';

-- Create an inline table-valued function
CREATE FUNCTION dbo.GetCustomersByCity (@CityName NVARCHAR(50))
RETURNS TABLE
AS
RETURN
(
    SELECT CustomerID, FirstName, LastName
    FROM Customers
    WHERE City = @CityName
);
GO

PRINT 'Function dbo.GetCustomersByCity created.';

-- Test the function
SELECT * FROM dbo.GetCustomersByCity('New York');
GO

-- Drop the function
DROP FUNCTION dbo.GetCustomersByCity;
GO

PRINT 'Function dbo.GetCustomersByCity dropped.';

-- Attempting to use it will now fail
-- SELECT * FROM dbo.GetCustomersByCity('London');
-- Error: "Could not find object or column or function dbo.GetCustomersByCity."
GO
```

**Example 3: Handling Dependencies - `DROP FUNCTION` will fail if schema-bound**

```sql
PRINT '--- Example 3: Handling Dependencies (Schema-Bound) ---';

-- Re-create the scalar function with SCHEMABINDING
CREATE FUNCTION dbo.GetFullName (@FirstName NVARCHAR(50), @LastName NVARCHAR(50))
RETURNS NVARCHAR(101)
WITH SCHEMABINDING
AS
BEGIN
    RETURN @FirstName + ' ' + @LastName;
END;
GO

-- Create a view that uses the schema-bound function
CREATE VIEW CustomerFullNames
AS
SELECT CustomerID, dbo.GetFullName(FirstName, LastName) AS FullName
FROM dbo.Customers;
GO

PRINT 'Function dbo.GetFullName and View CustomerFullNames (schema-bound) created.';

-- This will fail because CustomerFullNames view is schema-bound to dbo.GetFullName
-- DROP FUNCTION dbo.GetFullName;
-- Error: "Cannot DROP FUNCTION 'dbo.GetFullName' because it is being referenced by object 'CustomerFullNames'."

PRINT 'Attempting to drop dbo.GetFullName (will fail due to schema-bound dependency).';

-- To successfully drop dbo.GetFullName, you must first drop the dependent view
DROP VIEW dbo.CustomerFullNames;
GO
PRINT 'View CustomerFullNames dropped.';

-- Now, you can drop the function
DROP FUNCTION dbo.GetFullName;
GO
PRINT 'Function dbo.GetFullName dropped.';
```

**Example 4: `DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS`**

```sql
PRINT '--- Example 4: DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS ---';

-- This will not cause an error if NonExistentFunction does not exist
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS NonExistentFunction;
GO

-- Create a dummy function
CREATE FUNCTION dbo.TestFunc() RETURNS INT AS BEGIN RETURN 1; END;
GO

-- Drop it using IF EXISTS
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS dbo.TestFunc;
GO

PRINT 'NonExistentFunction or TestFunc dropped (or ignored if not found).';
```

### `DROP VIEW` - Deep Dive

The `DROP VIEW` statement is used to remove one or more views from the current database. A view is a virtual table whose content is defined by a query. It's often used to simplify complex queries, enforce security (by restricting access to certain columns/rows), or present data from multiple tables as a single logical entity.

#### Purpose and Importance

* **Schema Cleanup:** Removes obsolete or unused views, keeping the database schema tidy.
* **Refactoring:** Part of updating or restructuring the data presentation layer.
* **Security Adjustments:** If a view was used for security, dropping it removes that layer of abstraction and potentially changes access patterns.
* **Performance Optimization:** Sometimes, views are replaced with more efficient ones, or if they complicate query plans, they might be removed.
* **Deployment:** Used in deployment scripts to manage view versions.

#### Prerequisites and Considerations

1.  **Permissions:** You need `CONTROL` permission on the view, `ALTER` permission on the schema to which the view belongs, or `ALTER ANY VIEW` permission. Members of `db_ddladmin` or `db_owner` fixed database roles can drop views.
2.  **Dependencies:** This is the main consideration for `DROP VIEW`.
    * **Other Views:** If other views, stored procedures, or functions reference the view you are dropping, those objects will become invalid and fail at runtime. SQL Server will issue warnings.
    * **No Cascading:** SQL Server does *not* automatically drop or modify objects that reference the view you are dropping. It's your responsibility to manage these dependencies.
    * **Triggers:** You cannot create `INSTEAD OF` triggers directly on a view. If a trigger is defined on an underlying table, it is not affected by dropping a view that uses that table.
    * **`sys.sql_expression_dependencies`:** Use this system view to check for dependencies before dropping.
3.  **Data Persistence:** Dropping a view **does not delete the underlying data** in the base tables. It only removes the virtual table definition.
4.  **Functionality Impact:** Dropping a view immediately removes that specific data presentation, affecting any applications or queries that rely on it.
5.  **Transaction Context:** `DROP VIEW` can be executed within a transaction, allowing for `ROLLBACK` if something goes wrong.

#### Syntax

```sql
DROP VIEW [ IF EXISTS ] { [ schema_name. ] view_name } [ ,...n ]
[ ; ]
```

* `IF EXISTS`: (SQL Server 2016+) Prevents an error if the view does not exist.

#### Code Examples

**Setup (using the `Customers` table from before):**

```sql
USE tempdb;
GO

-- Ensure Customers table exists
IF OBJECT_ID('dbo.Customers', 'U') IS NULL
BEGIN
    CREATE TABLE Customers (
        CustomerID INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1,1),
        FirstName NVARCHAR(50),
        LastName NVARCHAR(50),
        DateOfBirth DATE,
        City NVARCHAR(50)
    );
    INSERT INTO Customers (FirstName, LastName, DateOfBirth, City) VALUES
    ('Alice', 'Smith', '1990-05-15', 'New York'),
    ('Bob', 'Johnson', '1985-11-20', 'London'),
    ('Charlie', 'Brown', '1992-03-01', 'New York');
END;
GO

PRINT 'Customers table ensured.';
```

**Example 1: Basic `DROP VIEW`**

```sql
PRINT '--- Example 1: Basic DROP VIEW ---';

-- Create a simple view
CREATE VIEW dbo.ActiveCustomers AS
SELECT CustomerID, FirstName, LastName, City
FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerID <= 2; -- Example condition
GO

PRINT 'View dbo.ActiveCustomers created.';

-- Query the view to verify
SELECT * FROM dbo.ActiveCustomers;
GO

-- Now, drop the view
DROP VIEW dbo.ActiveCustomers;
GO

PRINT 'View dbo.ActiveCustomers dropped.';

-- Attempting to query it will now fail
-- SELECT * FROM dbo.ActiveCustomers;
-- Error: "Invalid object name 'dbo.ActiveCustomers'."
GO
```

**Example 2: Dropping Multiple Views**

```sql
PRINT '--- Example 2: Dropping Multiple Views ---';

CREATE VIEW dbo.NYCustomers AS SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE City = 'New York';
CREATE VIEW dbo.OldCustomers AS SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE DateOfBirth < '1990-01-01';
GO

PRINT 'Views NYCustomers and OldCustomers created.';

DROP VIEW dbo.NYCustomers, dbo.OldCustomers;
GO

PRINT 'NYCustomers and OldCustomers views dropped.';
```

**Example 3: Handling Dependencies - `DROP VIEW` will succeed but invalidate dependent objects**

```sql
PRINT '--- Example 3: Handling Dependencies (Invalidating) ---';

-- Create a base view
CREATE VIEW dbo.CustomerContactInfo AS
SELECT CustomerID, FirstName, LastName, Email
FROM Customers;
GO

-- Create another view that references the first view
CREATE VIEW dbo.EmailList AS
SELECT Email FROM dbo.CustomerContactInfo; -- This view depends on CustomerContactInfo
GO

PRINT 'Views CustomerContactInfo and EmailList created.';

-- Query the dependent view
SELECT * FROM dbo.EmailList;
GO

-- Drop the base view (CustomerContactInfo)
-- This will succeed, but EmailList will become invalid
DROP VIEW dbo.CustomerContactInfo;
GO

PRINT 'View dbo.CustomerContactInfo dropped. dbo.EmailList is now invalid.';

-- Attempting to query the dependent view will now fail
-- SELECT * FROM dbo.EmailList;
-- Error: "Invalid object name 'dbo.CustomerContactInfo'."
GO

-- Clean up the invalid view
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS dbo.EmailList;
GO
PRINT 'Invalid view dbo.EmailList cleaned up.';
```

**Example 4: `DROP VIEW IF EXISTS`**

```sql
PRINT '--- Example 4: DROP VIEW IF EXISTS ---';

-- This will not cause an error if NonExistentView does not exist
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS NonExistentView;
GO

-- Create a dummy view
CREATE VIEW dbo.MyTempView AS SELECT 1 AS Col1;
GO

-- Drop it using IF EXISTS
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS dbo.MyTempView;
GO

PRINT 'NonExistentView or MyTempView dropped (or ignored if not found).';
```

**Cleanup:**

```sql
USE tempdb;
GO
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Customers;
GO
PRINT 'Customers table cleaned up.';
```

Both `DROP FUNCTION` and `DROP VIEW` are crucial for maintaining a healthy and organized database schema. While they don't cause data loss themselves, their impact on dependent objects and application functionality requires careful dependency checking and planning before execution in production environments.
