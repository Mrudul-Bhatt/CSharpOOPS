### **INSERT (SQL Graph) in SQL Server – Deep Dive with Code Examples**
SQL Graph is a feature introduced in **SQL Server 2017** that allows users to model **complex relationships** using **nodes and edges**, similar to graph databases like **Neo4j**. The `INSERT` statement in SQL Graph is used to **add nodes and edges** to a graph structure.

---
## **1️⃣ Understanding SQL Graph Basics**
✔ **Nodes** represent entities (e.g., people, products, locations).  
✔ **Edges** represent relationships between nodes (e.g., "works at," "buys from").  
✔ **Graph tables** store nodes and edges separately.  
✔ **Graph queries** use pattern matching (`MATCH`) for traversal.

---
## **2️⃣ Creating a Graph Database Structure**
Before inserting data, we need to **define nodes and edges**.

### **Step 1: Create Node Tables**
```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees_Graph (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name NVARCHAR(50)
) AS NODE;
```
```sql
CREATE TABLE Companies_Graph (
    CompanyID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name NVARCHAR(50)
) AS NODE;
```

### **Step 2: Create Edge Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE WorksAt (
    RelationshipID BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    StartNode REFERENCES Employees_Graph(EmployeeID),
    EndNode REFERENCES Companies_Graph(CompanyID)
) AS EDGE;
```

---
## **3️⃣ Inserting Data into Node Tables**
Nodes represent **entities**, so inserting data is similar to regular tables.

```sql
INSERT INTO Employees_Graph (EmployeeID, Name)
VALUES (1, 'Alice Johnson'), (2, 'Bob Smith');
```
```sql
INSERT INTO Companies_Graph (CompanyID, Name)
VALUES (101, 'TechCorp'), (102, 'FinanceInc');
```

---
## **4️⃣ Inserting Data into Edge Tables**
Edges define **relationships** between nodes.

```sql
INSERT INTO WorksAt ($from_id, $to_id)
VALUES ((SELECT $node_id FROM Employees_Graph WHERE EmployeeID = 1),
        (SELECT $node_id FROM Companies_Graph WHERE CompanyID = 101));
```

### **🔎 Explanation**
✔ **`$from_id` and `$to_id`** reference nodes in the graph.  
✔ **Links Alice Johnson to TechCorp** (Employee → Company).  
✔ **Graph relationships are stored separately** from node data.

---
## **5️⃣ Querying Graph Data Using MATCH**
Graph queries use **pattern matching** to find relationships.

```sql
SELECT e.Name, c.Name
FROM Employees_Graph e, WorksAt w, Companies_Graph c
WHERE MATCH (e-(w)->c);
```

### **🔎 What Happens?**
✔ Finds **employees and their companies**.  
✔ Uses **graph traversal** instead of traditional joins.  
✔ **Efficient for complex relationships** like social networks.

## **6️⃣ When to Use SQL Graph?**
🚀 **Social networks** (friend connections).  
🚀 **Fraud detection** (transaction patterns).  
🚀 **Recommendation engines** (product relationships).
