Great! Let's break down **DELETE vs. TRUNCATE TABLE** with deep insights and practical examples.

## **DELETE vs. TRUNCATE TABLE in SQL Server**
Both statements remove data from a table, but they work differently in terms of **performance, transaction logging, rollback capability, and identity column behavior**.

### **Key Differences**
| Feature                | DELETE | TRUNCATE TABLE |
|------------------------|--------|---------------|
| Row-by-row removal     | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No |
| Logged in transaction log | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå Minimal logging |
| Can be rolled back    | ‚úÖ Yes, if inside a transaction | ‚úÖ Yes, but only inside a transaction (from SQL Server 2016 onward) |
| Resets identity column | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Faster execution      | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Triggers execution   | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No |

## **Deep Dive with Examples**
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ DELETE Example ‚Äì Removes Specific Rows**
```sql
-- Create and populate a sample table
CREATE TABLE Employee (
    EmpID INT IDENTITY(1,1),
    Name NVARCHAR(50),
    Department NVARCHAR(50)
);

INSERT INTO Employee (Name, Department) VALUES
('Alice', 'HR'),
('Bob', 'IT'),
('Charlie', 'Finance');

-- Delete only one row
DELETE FROM Employee WHERE Name = 'Bob';

-- Check remaining records
SELECT * FROM Employee;
```
### **üîé Explanation**
- `DELETE FROM Employee WHERE Name = 'Bob';` removes **only Bob‚Äôs record**.
- The transaction log keeps track of every deleted row, making rollback possible.
- **Triggers** (if any exist) are fired for each deleted row.
- **Identity column** remains unchanged.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ TRUNCATE TABLE Example ‚Äì Removes All Rows**
```sql
-- Create and populate another table
CREATE TABLE Sales (
    SaleID INT IDENTITY(1,1),
    Amount DECIMAL(10,2),
    SaleDate DATE
);

INSERT INTO Sales (Amount, SaleDate) VALUES
(1000, '2025-05-01'),
(500, '2025-05-02'),
(1500, '2025-05-03');

-- Remove all records efficiently
TRUNCATE TABLE Sales;

-- Check table data
SELECT * FROM Sales;  -- Returns empty result
```
### **üîé Explanation**
- `TRUNCATE TABLE Sales;` removes **all rows instantly**.
- **Minimal logging** makes it much faster than `DELETE`.
- **Identity column resets**, meaning if new data is inserted, IDs start from **1 again**.
- **Triggers do NOT fire**.

## **Rollback Behavior**
**DELETE** can be rolled back easily inside a transaction:
```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
DELETE FROM Employee;
ROLLBACK;  -- Undo the deletion
SELECT * FROM Employee;  -- Data is restored
```

**TRUNCATE TABLE** (from SQL Server 2016 onward) can also be rolled back inside a transaction:
```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
TRUNCATE TABLE Sales;
ROLLBACK;  -- Undo the truncation
SELECT * FROM Sales;  -- Data is restored
```

## **When to Use What?**
- **Use DELETE** when you need to **remove specific records** and possibly log each change.
- **Use TRUNCATE TABLE** when you need to **clear the table entirely**, especially for performance optimization.
