`RESTORE VERIFYONLY` is a crucial command in SQL Server backup and recovery. While `BACKUP DATABASE` creates a backup and `RESTORE DATABASE` actually brings a database online from a backup, `RESTORE VERIFYONLY` sits in between, providing a vital step for **proactive backup validation**.

### 3. `RESTORE VERIFYONLY` - Deep Dive

The `RESTORE VERIFYONLY` statement is used to check the readability and structural integrity of a backup file without actually performing a restore operation. It's a non-destructive command that helps ensure that your backup file is usable if a disaster strikes.

#### Purpose and Importance

* **Proactive Validation:** The primary purpose is to confirm that a backup file is complete and readable. This is critical because a backup that cannot be restored is useless.
* **Early Detection of Issues:** It helps identify potential problems with the backup media (e.g., faulty disk sectors, network issues during backup, corrupted backup file) *before* a disaster occurs.
* **Checks Backup Set Headers:** Verifies that the backup set headers are valid and readable.
* **Checks Data Consistency (with CHECKSUM):** If the original backup was taken with `WITH CHECKSUM`, `RESTORE VERIFYONLY` will also verify the checksums stored within the backup, ensuring data pages were written correctly. This is a very strong reason to always use `WITH CHECKSUM` during your `BACKUP` operations.
* **Performance:** It's generally much faster than a full restore, making it suitable for routine checks.
* **Does NOT:**
    * Restore any data.
    * Bring a database online.
    * Check the logical consistency of the data *within* the database (e.g., if application-level data is correct, for that you need `DBCC CHECKDB` on the restored database).

#### How it Works

When you run `RESTORE VERIFYONLY`, SQL Server reads the entire backup file, decompresses it (if compressed), and performs checks similar to what it would do during a full restore, but it doesn't write any data files to disk.

Specifically, it checks:
1.  **Backup File Readability:** Can the SQL Server instance read the entire backup file from start to finish?
2.  **Backup Set Structure:** Are the backup set and media headers valid and correctly formatted?
3.  **Checksums (if present):** If `WITH CHECKSUM` was used during the backup, `RESTORE VERIFYONLY` will verify the checksums of the data pages within the backup, ensuring the data blocks themselves haven't been corrupted during the backup process or storage.

#### Syntax

```sql
RESTORE VERIFYONLY
FROM <backup_device> [ ,...n ]
[ WITH <restore_option> [ ,...n ] ]
```

* **`<backup_device>`**: Specifies the location of the backup file(s). This can be a disk path, a tape drive, or a URL for Azure Blob Storage.
* **`<restore_option>`**: While fewer options are relevant compared to `RESTORE DATABASE`, some are useful:
    * `FILE = backup_set_file_number`: If your backup file contains multiple backup sets (e.g., a full and a differential backup appended to the same file), you can specify which one to verify.
    * `PASSWORD = { 'password' | @password_variable }`: If the backup was password protected.
    * `NOUNLOAD`, `REWIND`: For tape devices.
    * `MEDIANAME`, `MEDIAPASSWORD`: For media sets.
    * `STATS = n`: Displays progress percentage.

### Code Examples

Let's illustrate with examples using our `MyTestDB` backups.

**Scenario:** We have a full backup and a differential backup, potentially in separate files or within one file.

**1. Verifying a Single Full Backup File:**

This is the most common use case for a standalone backup file.

```sql
-- Assume 'MyTestDB_Full_20250524.bak' was created with WITH CHECKSUM.
RESTORE VERIFYONLY
FROM DISK = 'D:\SQLBackups\MyTestDB_Full_20250524.bak'
WITH STATS = 10; -- Show progress every 10%
GO
```

**Expected Output on Success:**
`The backup set on device 'D:\SQLBackups\MyTestDB_Full_20250524.bak' is valid.`

**Expected Output on Failure (Example: Corrupted file or wrong file type):**
You might see error messages like:
`Msg 3241, Level 16, State 0, Line 1`
`The media family on device 'D:\SQLBackups\CorruptedBackup.bak' is incorrectly formed. SQL Server cannot process this media family.`
Or checksum errors if `CHECKSUM` was used during backup and corruption occurred.

**2. Verifying a Differential Backup File:**

You can verify a differential backup independently.

```sql
RESTORE VERIFYONLY
FROM DISK = 'D:\SQLBackups\MyTestDB_Diff_20250524_1.bak'
WITH STATS = 10;
GO
```

**3. Verifying a Transaction Log Backup File:**

Similarly, for log backups.

```sql
RESTORE VERIFYONLY
FROM DISK = 'D:\SQLBackups\MyTestDB_Log_20250524_1.trn'
WITH STATS = 10;
GO
```

**4. Verifying a Specific Backup Set within a Multi-Backup File:**

If you have appended multiple backups to the same file, you'll need the `FILE` option.

```sql
-- First, determine the file number for the desired backup set.
-- Let's assume 'D:\SQLBackups\MultiBackupFile.bak' contains:
-- File 1: Full Backup
-- File 2: Differential Backup
-- File 3: Log Backup

RESTORE HEADERONLY FROM DISK = 'D:\SQLBackups\MultiBackupFile.bak';
GO

-- Now, verify the differential backup (which is File 2 in this example).
RESTORE VERIFYONLY
FROM DISK = 'D:\SQLBackups\MultiBackupFile.bak'
WITH FILE = 2,
     STATS = 10;
GO
```

**5. Verifying a Password-Protected Backup:**

If you backed up with `ENCRYPTION` and a certificate/asymmetric key, or an older backup with `PASSWORD`, you'd need to supply it.

```sql
-- Assuming backup was taken with PASSWORD = 'MyStrongPassword'
RESTORE VERIFYONLY
FROM DISK = 'D:\SQLBackups\MyTestDB_Encrypted.bak'
WITH PASSWORD = 'MyStrongPassword',
     STATS = 10;
GO
```

#### Best Practices for `RESTORE VERIFYONLY`:

1.  **Automate Verification:** Include `RESTORE VERIFYONLY` as a step in your automated backup jobs (e.g., SQL Server Agent jobs or Maintenance Plans). This ensures that each backup you create is immediately checked for integrity.
2.  **Always use `WITH CHECKSUM` for Backups:** This is paramount. `RESTORE VERIFYONLY` is significantly more effective at detecting corruption when the backup itself contains checksums. Without checksums, `VERIFYONLY` can only check the structural integrity of the backup file, not the data pages within it.
3.  **Run Periodically:** Even if you automate it after each backup, consider running `RESTORE VERIFYONLY` on older backups occasionally, especially if they are moved to different storage or accessed infrequently. This checks for potential media degradation.
4.  **Don't Substitute for Full Restore Tests:** While `RESTORE VERIFYONLY` is excellent for quick checks, it's NOT a replacement for periodically performing a full `RESTORE DATABASE` to a separate test environment. A full restore test validates not only the backup file but also the entire recovery process, including file paths, permissions, and database consistency (`DBCC CHECKDB` on the restored database).
5.  **Monitor Results:** Ensure that your backup job monitoring includes checking the results of the `RESTORE VERIFYONLY` step. Any failure should trigger an immediate alert.

In summary, `RESTORE VERIFYONLY` is a lightweight yet powerful tool for proactive backup validation. Incorporating it into your backup strategy, especially in conjunction with `WITH CHECKSUM` during backup operations, is a critical step in building a robust and reliable disaster recovery plan.
