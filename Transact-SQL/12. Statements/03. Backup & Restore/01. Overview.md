When it comes to SQL Server backup and restore from an interview perspective, you'll want to focus on the core concepts and the most frequently used commands. While all the statements you listed are part of the backup and restore functionality, some are far more critical to understand deeply than others.

Here's a breakdown of the most important ones, along with why they are important for an interview:

### Most Important Statements for Interviews:

1.  **`BACKUP DATABASE`**:
    * **Why it's important:** This is the bread and butter of backing up. You must understand how to perform full, differential, and transaction log backups. Interviewers will likely ask about the syntax, options (e.g., `WITH COMPRESSION`, `INIT`, `NOINIT`, `FORMAT`, `NOFORMAT`, `STATS`), and the differences between backup types.
    * **Key concepts to know:** Recovery models (Full, Simple, Bulk-Logged) and how they influence backup strategy.

2.  **`RESTORE DATABASE`**:
    * **Why it's important:** Just as important as backing up, you need to know how to restore. Interviewers will ask about restoring full, differential, and transaction log backups in sequence.
    * **Key concepts to know:**
        * `WITH RECOVERY`: The default, brings the database online and rolls back uncommitted transactions. No further log backups can be applied.
        * `WITH NORECOVERY`: Leaves the database in a restoring state, allowing subsequent differential or transaction log backups to be applied.
        * `WITH STANDBY`: Allows read-only access to the database while in a restoring state, enabling log backups to be applied later.
        * `WITH MOVE`: Essential for restoring a database to a different location or with different file names.
        * Point-in-time recovery using `STOPAT` or `STOPATMARK`.
        * The process of restoring a database (full -> differential -> log backups).

3.  **`RESTORE VERIFYONLY`**:
    * **Why it's important:** This command is crucial for validating the integrity of a backup file without actually restoring it. Interviewers often ask how you ensure your backups are good, and this is the primary answer.

4.  **`RESTORE FILELISTONLY`**:
    * **Why it's important:** This command helps you get metadata about the backup set, including the logical and physical file names. This is vital when performing a `RESTORE DATABASE WITH MOVE` to know what to move. It shows you what files are contained within a backup.

### Less Frequently Asked, but Good to Know:

* **`BACKUP LOG`**: While you'll discuss it as part of transaction log backups, the standalone command isn't as heavily drilled as `BACKUP DATABASE`. However, understanding its purpose in the Full and Bulk-Logged recovery models is essential.
* **`RESTORE HEADERONLY`**: Provides header information about a backup set (e.g., backup type, start/end times, LSNs). Useful for understanding the backup history.
* **`RESTORE LABELONLY`**: Provides information about the backup media itself, not the backup sets. Less frequently needed than `HEADERONLY`.

### Niche/Advanced (Less Likely to be asked in a general interview, more for senior roles):

* **Backup/Restore of Encryption Keys (`BACKUP CERTIFICATE`, `BACKUP MASTER KEY`, `BACKUP SERVICE MASTER KEY`, `BACKUP SYMMETRIC KEY`, `RESTORE MASTER KEY`, `RESTORE SERVICE MASTER KEY`, `RESTORE SYMMETRIC KEY`)**: These are specific to database encryption (TDE, Always Encrypted, etc.). If the role doesn't explicitly mention security or advanced encryption, you might not be asked about these. However, understanding that master keys and certificates need to be backed up for disaster recovery of encrypted databases is a good sign of a well-rounded DBA.
* **`RESTORE REWINDONLY`**: This is primarily used with tape devices to rewind the tape. In modern environments, with disk-based backups being prevalent, it's rarely encountered.

### General Interview Topics Related to Backup and Restore:

Beyond the specific statements, be prepared to discuss:

* **Recovery Models:** Deep understanding of Full, Simple, and Bulk-Logged recovery models and when to use each.
* **Backup Strategy:** How to design a comprehensive backup strategy (full, differential, log backups, frequency, retention, offsite storage).
* **Disaster Recovery (DR):** How backups play a role in DR planning.
* **Monitoring Backups:** How to ensure backups are successful (SQL Server Agent jobs, error logs, `msdb` tables).
* **Permissions:** What permissions are needed to perform backup and restore operations.
* **Backup Compression and Encryption:** When and why to use them.
* **Tail-Log Backups:** Importance of taking a tail-log backup before restoring to prevent data loss.
* **Automating Backups:** Using SQL Server Agent jobs or Maintenance Plans.

Focus your study on `BACKUP DATABASE`, `RESTORE DATABASE` (with all its key options), `RESTORE VERIFYONLY`, and `RESTORE FILELISTONLY`, and you'll be well-prepared for most interview questions related to SQL Server backup and restore.
