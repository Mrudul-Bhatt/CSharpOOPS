`RESTORE FILELISTONLY` is an indispensable command for anyone managing SQL Server backups, especially when dealing with restores to different locations or when you need to understand the contents of a backup file without actually restoring it.

### 4. `RESTORE FILELISTONLY` - Deep Dive

The `RESTORE FILELISTONLY` statement provides detailed information about the data and log files contained within a backup set. It reads the backup file's headers and presents a tabular result set with crucial metadata about each file in the backup.

#### Purpose and Importance

* **Pre-Restore Planning:** Its primary purpose is to help you plan a restore operation, particularly when you need to use the `WITH MOVE` option to place database files in new locations. It shows you the *logical names* and *original physical paths* of the files.
* **Identify Files:** It lists all data (`.mdf`, `.ndf`) and log (`.ldf`) files included in the backup.
* **Determine Logical Names:** The logical names are internal identifiers that SQL Server uses for the database files. These are critical for the `MOVE` clause in `RESTORE DATABASE`.
* **Original Physical Paths:** It shows where the files were located on the original server when the backup was taken. This is often different from where you want to restore them.
* **File Type and Filegroup Information:** It indicates whether a file is a data file (D) or log file (L) and to which filegroup a data file belongs.
* **Non-Destructive:** Like `RESTORE VERIFYONLY`, it doesn't actually restore the database or modify any existing files. It just reads the backup file.
* **Quick Examination:** It's a very fast operation, as it only reads the header information of the backup set, not the entire data content.

#### Syntax

```sql
RESTORE FILELISTONLY
FROM <backup_device> [ ,...n ]
[ WITH <restore_option> [ ,...n ] ]
```

* **`<backup_device>`**: Specifies the location of the backup file(s). This can be a disk path, a tape drive, or a URL for Azure Blob Storage.
* **`<restore_option>`**: Relevant options include:
    * `FILE = backup_set_file_number`: To specify which backup set to inspect if the backup media contains multiple backup sets.
    * `PASSWORD = { 'password' | @password_variable }`: If the backup was password protected.
    * `MEDIANAME`, `MEDIAPASSWORD`: For media sets.

### Code Examples

Let's assume we have a full backup of `MyTestDB` created earlier, named `MyTestDB_Full_20250524.bak`.

**1. Basic Usage of `RESTORE FILELISTONLY`**

```sql
RESTORE FILELISTONLY
FROM DISK = 'D:\SQLBackups\MyTestDB_Full_20250524.bak';
GO
```

**Example Output:**

| :------------- | :--------------------------------------- | :--- | :------------ | :------------ | :------------ | :----- | :---------------- | :---------------- | :----------------------------------- | :---------------- | :---------------- | :---------------- | :-------------- | :---------- | :----------------------------------- | :------------------ | :------------------- | :--------- | :-------- | :------------ | :------------------------------- |
| MyTestDB       | C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\... \MyTestDB.mdf | D    | PRIMARY       | 8388608       | 274877906944  | 1      | 0                 | 0                 | 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 | 0                 | 0                 | 8388608           | 512             | 1           | NULL                                 | 36000000000000000   | 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 | 0          | 1         | NULL          | NULL                             |
| MyTestDB_log   | C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\... \MyTestDB_log.ldf | L    | NULL          | 8388608       | 2199023255552 | 2      | 36000000000000000 | 0                 | 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 | 0                 | 0                 | 0                 | 512             | 0           | 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 | 0                   | 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 | 0          | 1         | NULL          | NULL                             |

**Key Columns to Focus On:**

* **`LogicalName`**: This is the internal name of the database file. You **must** use these names in the `MOVE` clause of your `RESTORE DATABASE` statement. In our example: `MyTestDB` (data file) and `MyTestDB_log` (log file).
* **`PhysicalName`**: This is the original path where the file resided on the source server. This might be different from your target server's desired paths.
* **`Type`**: Indicates the file type: `D` for data file, `L` for log file.
* **`FileGroupName`**: For data files, this indicates the filegroup it belongs to (e.g., `PRIMARY`). For log files, it's `NULL`.
* **`Size`**: The size of the file in bytes at the time of the backup.

**2. Using `RESTORE FILELISTONLY` with the `FILE` Option (for multiple backup sets):**

If your backup media (e.g., a single `.bak` file) contains multiple backup sets (e.g., a full backup followed by a differential backup appended to the same file), you can specify which backup set's file list you want to see.

```sql
-- First, identify the backup sets and their FILE numbers using RESTORE HEADERONLY.
-- Let's assume 'D:\SQLBackups\MultiBackupFile.bak' contains:
-- FILE = 1: Full Backup
-- FILE = 2: Differential Backup
-- FILE = 3: Log Backup

RESTORE HEADERONLY FROM DISK = 'D:\SQLBackups\MultiBackupFile.bak';
GO

-- Now, get the file list for the differential backup (FILE = 2).
RESTORE FILELISTONLY
FROM DISK = 'D:\SQLBackups\MultiBackupFile.bak'
WITH FILE = 2;
GO
```

**Expected Output for Differential Backup:**
The output would be similar to the full backup, but it only lists the files that were part of that specific differential backup set. The `PhysicalName` column would show the original paths, and the `LogicalName` columns are what you'd use for `MOVE`.

**3. Practical Application: Restoring to a New Location (using `MOVE`):**

This is the most common scenario where `RESTORE FILELISTONLY` becomes invaluable.

**Step 1: Get File Information**

```sql
-- Step 1: Find out the logical names and original paths from the backup.
RESTORE FILELISTONLY
FROM DISK = 'D:\SQLBackups\MyTestDB_Full_20250524.bak';
GO
```
(Examine the output, note `LogicalName` values like 'MyTestDB' and 'MyTestDB_log')

**Step 2: Perform the Restore with `MOVE`**

Based on the `LogicalName` values from Step 1, you can now construct your `RESTORE DATABASE` command with the `MOVE` option to place the files in your desired new paths.

```sql
-- Step 2: Restore the database to a new name and/or new paths.
RESTORE DATABASE MyTestDB_Recovered -- New database name
FROM DISK = 'D:\SQLBackups\MyTestDB_Full_20250524.bak'
WITH MOVE 'MyTestDB' TO 'E:\SQLData\MyTestDB_Recovered.mdf', -- New data file path
     MOVE 'MyTestDB_log' TO 'F:\SQLLogs\MyTestDB_Recovered_log.ldf', -- New log file path
     RECOVERY, -- Bring the database online after restore
     STATS = 10;
GO
```

**Important Note:** The logical names ('MyTestDB', 'MyTestDB_log') must match *exactly* what `RESTORE FILELISTONLY` returned. The physical paths (`E:\SQLData\MyTestDB_Recovered.mdf`, `F:\SQLLogs\MyTestDB_Recovered_log.ldf`) are your desired new locations on the target server.

#### Best Practices for `RESTORE FILELISTONLY`:

1.  **Always Use Before `RESTORE DATABASE WITH MOVE`:** Make it a habit to run `RESTORE FILELISTONLY` before any `RESTORE DATABASE` operation where you intend to move the files. This prevents errors due to incorrect logical names or path issues.
2.  **Combine with `RESTORE HEADERONLY`:** If you're dealing with a single backup file that might contain multiple backup sets (e.g., from an append-to-media strategy), use `RESTORE HEADERONLY` first to identify the correct `FILE` number, and then use that `FILE` number with `RESTORE FILELISTONLY`.
3.  **Scripting Restores:** When scripting restore processes for disaster recovery, include `RESTORE FILELISTONLY` in your script to dynamically generate the `MOVE` clauses if the target server's file paths are not fixed or need to adapt.
4.  **Troubleshooting:** If a `RESTORE DATABASE` command with `MOVE` fails, using `RESTORE FILELISTONLY` is one of the first troubleshooting steps to verify the logical names you are using.

In essence, `RESTORE FILELISTONLY` is your guide to navigating the internal structure of a backup file, providing the critical pieces of information (logical names) needed to successfully place database files during a restore operation, especially in new or non-standard environments.
