From an interview perspective for Transact-SQL in Microsoft SQL Server, the key is to demonstrate a solid understanding of how security and access control work, as well as an awareness of cryptographic operations.

Here's a breakdown of the *most important* permission-related statements, why they are important, and what aspects to focus on for an interview:

### Core Permission Management Commands (Absolutely Essential)

1.  **`GRANT`**:
    * **Why important:** The fundamental command to give permissions. You must know its syntax and how it applies to various securables (databases, tables, views, stored procedures, schemas, etc.).
    * **Interview focus:**
        * Basic syntax: `GRANT <permission> ON <securable> TO <principal>;`
        * Common permissions: `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `EXECUTE`, `ALTER`, `CONTROL`.
        * Granting permissions on: Tables, Views, Stored Procedures, Functions, Schemas, Databases, Server.
        * `WITH GRANT OPTION`: What it does (allows the grantee to further grant the permission).
        * Permissions hierarchy/cascading: How permissions are inherited or overridden.

2.  **`DENY`**:
    * **Why important:** The most powerful permission statement. `DENY` *always* takes precedence over `GRANT`. It's crucial for restricting access.
    * **Interview focus:**
        * Syntax: `DENY <permission> ON <securable> TO <principal>;`
        * The "deny trumps grant" rule: Be ready to explain this thoroughly with examples (e.g., if a user is part of two roles, one `GRANT`s and one `DENY`s, `DENY` wins).
        * Common use cases: Restricting specific operations, preventing access to sensitive columns/rows via views.

3.  **`REVOKE`**:
    * **Why important:** Used to remove previously granted or denied permissions.
    * **Interview focus:**
        * Syntax: `REVOKE <permission> ON <securable> FROM <principal>;`
        * Distinction from `DENY`: `REVOKE` simply removes the permission entry; `DENY` explicitly forbids it. If a permission was `GRANT`ed and then `REVOKE`d, the permission is removed. If it was `GRANT`ed, then `DENY`d, then `REVOKE`d, the `DENY` might still be active if it came from another source (e.g., role membership).
        * `REVOKE CASCADE` (for schema-bound objects): Less common, but good to know it exists.
        * `REVOKE GRANT OPTION FOR`: Removes the ability to grant a permission, but leaves the permission itself.

### Security Context & Impersonation (Very Important)

4.  **`EXECUTE AS` (and `REVERT`)**:
    * **Why important:** Essential for managing execution context, especially in stored procedures and functions. It's a cornerstone of the "chain of ownership" (or "ownership chaining") security model.
    * **Interview focus:**
        * **Purpose:** What problem does it solve (e.g., allowing a user to run a procedure that accesses data they don't directly have permission to, by executing as the procedure's owner).
        * Types of `EXECUTE AS`: `CALLER`, `OWNER`, `USER = 'some_user_name'`, `LOGIN = 'some_login_name'`.
        * `EXECUTE AS OWNER`: Default for procedures, explains ownership chaining.
        * `EXECUTE AS USER/LOGIN`: Explicit impersonation.
        * `REVERT`: How to switch back to the original security context.
        * Security implications and best practices (e.g., using `EXECUTE AS` to grant least privilege, avoiding `EXECUTE AS 'dbo'`).
        * When `EXECUTE AS CALLER` is necessary (e.g., when the caller's permissions are explicitly needed).

### Cryptographic Operations (Important for Security Roles)

5.  **`OPEN MASTER KEY` / `CLOSE MASTER KEY`**:
    * **Why important:** The Database Master Key (DMK) is the root of the database encryption hierarchy. Knowing how to open/close it is fundamental for using other encryption features (certificates, symmetric/asymmetric keys).
    * **Interview focus:**
        * Why it's needed (to decrypt keys protected by the DMK).
        * Security implications of leaving it open (should be closed when not needed).
        * When it automatically opens (e.g., when a credential that uses the DMK is accessed).

6.  **`OPEN SYMMETRIC KEY` / `CLOSE SYMMETRIC KEY`**:
    * **Why important:** Symmetric keys are used for bulk data encryption. You need to open them to encrypt/decrypt data using `ENCRYPTBYKEY`/`DECRYPTBYKEY`.
    * **Interview focus:**
        * Purpose: Encrypt/decrypt actual data.
        * Relationship to DMK/Certificates/Asymmetric Keys (how they are protected).
        * Why closing is important (security).

7.  **`ADD SIGNATURE`**:
    * **Why important:** Less common for day-to-day work, but critical for code signing and module signing. It allows granting permissions to a stored procedure or function without granting them directly to the calling user, based on the certificate/key signature.
    * **Interview focus:**
        * Concept of module signing.
        * Why it's used (fine-grained permission control, "trusted subsystem").
        * How it works with certificates/asymmetric keys.

### Less Frequent But Good to Know

* **`SETUSER`**: Older syntax, largely superseded by `EXECUTE AS`. Mention it if asked about legacy methods, but focus on `EXECUTE AS`.
* **Specific `DENY`/`GRANT`/`REVOKE` Permission Types (e.g., `DENY Assembly Permissions`, `GRANT Availability Group Permissions`):** While you don't need to memorize *every single permission type*, be aware that permissions are granular and apply to different securable classes (server, database, object, schema, etc.). Being able to discuss the *concept* of granular permissions is good. For example, `DENY Object Permissions` is a general category, but you should know that specific objects like tables have `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` permissions.

### What to De-emphasize (unless specific role requires it)

* **Extensive lists of specific permissions for every securable type:** You don't need to list all "Availability Group Permissions" unless you're applying for an HA/DR specialist role. Focus on the core `GRANT`/`DENY`/`REVOKE` principles.
* **Rarely used specific clauses:** Stick to the most common scenarios.

### Preparation Strategy for an Interview

1.  **Understand the Hierarchy:** Be able to draw or explain the SQL Server security hierarchy (Server Logins -> Database Users -> Roles -> Schemas -> Objects).
2.  **Practice Scenarios:** Think about common security scenarios and how you'd use `GRANT`, `DENY`, `REVOKE`, and `EXECUTE AS` to solve them (e.g., "How would you give a user read-only access to a specific table in a database?" or "How would you allow a user to run a stored procedure that modifies data, without giving them direct modify access to the table?").
3.  **Key Differences:** Clearly articulate the difference between `GRANT` vs. `DENY`, `REVOKE` vs. `DENY`, and the purpose of `EXECUTE AS`.
4.  **Cryptographic Basics:** Know the purpose of the DMK, certificates, and symmetric keys, and how `OPEN`/`CLOSE` relate to their use.

By focusing on these core commands and their underlying principles, you'll be well-prepared to discuss security and permissions in a SQL Server interview.
