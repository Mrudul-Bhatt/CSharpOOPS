Let's delve deeply into the `ADD SIGNATURE` statement in Transact-SQL. `ADD SIGNATURE` is a powerful, though somewhat advanced, security feature in SQL Server that allows you to sign stored procedures, functions, triggers, and assemblies with a certificate or an asymmetric key. This mechanism is crucial for establishing trust and implementing fine-grained permission control through **module signing**.

---

### `ADD SIGNATURE` - Deep Dive

`ADD SIGNATURE` cryptographically signs a module (stored procedure, function, trigger, or assembly) using the private key of a specified certificate or asymmetric key. When a signed module is executed, SQL Server can verify the signature using the corresponding public key. This verification allows SQL Server to assign permissions to the module itself, based on the permissions granted to the certificate or asymmetric key, which the executing principal then implicitly inherits.

#### Purpose and Importance (Module Signing)

The primary purpose of `ADD SIGNATURE` is to implement the **trusted subsystem model** or **module signing**. It addresses a common security challenge:

* **Problem:** You want a user to be able to execute a stored procedure that performs an action (e.g., `UPDATE` a sensitive table), but you *don't* want to grant the user direct `UPDATE` permission on that table. If you simply use `EXECUTE AS OWNER` for the procedure, the user effectively gains the owner's permissions, which might be too broad (e.g., `db_owner`).
* **Solution with Module Signing:**
    1.  Create a certificate or asymmetric key in the database (or server).
    2.  Grant *only the necessary permissions* (e.g., `UPDATE` on the sensitive table) to that certificate or asymmetric key.
    3.  Sign the stored procedure with the *private key* of that certificate/asymmetric key using `ADD SIGNATURE`.
    4.  Grant the user only `EXECUTE` permission on the stored procedure.

  When the user executes the signed procedure, SQL Server verifies the signature. If valid, the procedure temporarily "inherits" the permissions granted to the certificate/asymmetric key. The user is still only executing the procedure, but the procedure itself has the elevated permissions it needs, without those permissions being directly granted to the user. This is a highly effective way to implement the principle of **least privilege**.

* **Integrity:** The signature also acts as a checksum. If the module's definition is altered after signing, the signature verification will fail, preventing the module from executing with the signed permissions. This protects against tampering.
* **Auditing:** Module signing enhances auditability, as you can track who executed the signed module and what permissions were exercised through the signature.

#### Key Concepts

* **Module:** The Transact-SQL object being signed: `PROCEDURE`, `FUNCTION`, `TRIGGER`, or `ASSEMBLY`.
* **Signing Principal:** The certificate or asymmetric key whose private key is used to create the signature.
    * **Certificate:** Recommended for signing database objects. Their private keys are protected by the Database Master Key (DMK).
    * **Asymmetric Key:** Can also be used, typically for server-level objects or when using external key management. Its private key is also protected by the DMK.
* **Database Master Key (DMK):** The DMK must be open to sign a module, as it protects the private key of the certificate/asymmetric key used for signing.

#### Syntax

```sql
ADD SIGNATURE TO
    { { OBJECT :: object_name | TYPE :: type_name } | ASSEMBLY :: assembly_name }
    BY { CERTIFICATE certificate_name | ASYMMETRIC KEY asymmetric_key_name }
[ ; ]
```

* `OBJECT :: object_name`: Specifies a stored procedure, function, or trigger.
* `TYPE :: type_name`: Specifies a CLR user-defined type.
* `ASSEMBLY :: assembly_name`: Specifies a CLR assembly.
* `BY CERTIFICATE certificate_name`: The certificate whose private key will be used.
* `BY ASYMMETRIC KEY asymmetric_key_name`: The asymmetric key whose private key will be used.

#### Removing a Signature

Use `DROP SIGNATURE` to remove a signature from a module.

```sql
DROP SIGNATURE FROM
    { { OBJECT :: object_name | TYPE :: type_name } | ASSEMBLY :: assembly_name }
    BY { CERTIFICATE certificate_name | ASYMMETRIC KEY asymmetric_key_name }
[ ; ]
```

#### Permissions Required

* **To `ADD SIGNATURE`:**
    * `ALTER` permission on the module being signed.
    * `CONTROL` permission on the certificate or asymmetric key used for signing.
    * The Database Master Key (DMK) must be open if the certificate/asymmetric key's private key is protected by it.

#### Security Flow with Module Signing

1.  **DBA creates Certificate/Asymmetric Key:**
    ```sql
    CREATE CERTIFICATE MySigningCert WITH SUBJECT = 'For Signing Procedures';
    ```
2.  **DBA grants permissions to the Certificate/Asymmetric Key:**
    ```sql
    GRANT UPDATE ON dbo.SensitiveTable TO MySigningCert; -- Granting permission to the certificate
    ```
3.  **Developer/DBA creates the Stored Procedure:**
    ```sql
    CREATE PROCEDURE UpdateSensitiveData
    AS
    BEGIN
        UPDATE dbo.SensitiveTable SET LastUpdated = GETDATE();
    END;
    ```
4.  **DBA signs the Stored Procedure:** (DMK must be open here)
    ```sql
    ADD SIGNATURE TO OBJECT :: dbo.UpdateSensitiveData BY CERTIFICATE MySigningCert;
    ```
5.  **DBA grants `EXECUTE` permission to the User:**
    ```sql
    GRANT EXECUTE ON dbo.UpdateSensitiveData TO MyUser;
    ```
6.  **User executes the procedure:**
    ```sql
    EXEC dbo.UpdateSensitiveData;
    ```
    * SQL Server checks if `MyUser` has `EXECUTE` permission on `UpdateSensitiveData`. (Yes)
    * SQL Server verifies the signature of `UpdateSensitiveData` using `MySigningCert`'s public key. (If valid, it knows the module hasn't been tampered with and was signed by `MySigningCert`'s owner).
    * Because the module is signed by `MySigningCert`, the procedure's execution effectively "inherits" the permissions of `MySigningCert`.
    * `MySigningCert` has `UPDATE` permission on `SensitiveTable`, so the `UPDATE` statement inside the procedure succeeds, even though `MyUser` does not have direct `UPDATE` permission on `SensitiveTable`.

#### Code Examples

**Setup:**

```sql
USE master;
GO

-- Clean up previous demo objects if they exist
IF DB_ID('SignatureDemoDB') IS NOT NULL DROP DATABASE SignatureDemoDB;
IF LOGIN_ID('LimitedAppUserLogin') IS NOT NULL DROP LOGIN LimitedAppUserLogin;
GO

CREATE DATABASE SignatureDemoDB;
GO
USE SignatureDemoDB;
GO

PRINT 'SignatureDemoDB created.';

-- 1. Create a Database Master Key (DMK) - essential for protecting private keys
CREATE MASTER KEY ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD = 'MyStrongDMKPassword!1';
GO
PRINT 'Database Master Key created.';

-- 2. Create a sensitive table
CREATE TABLE CustomerData (
    CustomerID INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1,1),
    CustomerName NVARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    Email NVARCHAR(255) NULL,
    SensitiveInfo NVARCHAR(MAX) NULL -- This column is sensitive
);

INSERT INTO CustomerData (CustomerName, SensitiveInfo) VALUES
('Alice Smith', 'Credit Card: **** **** **** 1234'),
('Bob Johnson', 'SSN: XXX-XX-5678');
GO
PRINT 'CustomerData table created and populated.';

-- 3. Create a login and user who should *not* have direct access to SensitiveInfo
CREATE LOGIN LimitedAppUserLogin WITH PASSWORD = 'Password123!', CHECK_EXPIRATION = OFF, CHECK_POLICY = OFF;
CREATE USER LimitedAppUser FOR LOGIN LimitedAppUserLogin;
GO
PRINT 'LimitedAppUserLogin and LimitedAppUser created.';

-- Verify LimitedAppUser cannot select SensitiveInfo directly (initial state)
EXECUTE AS USER = 'LimitedAppUser';
BEGIN TRY
    SELECT 'LimitedAppUser trying direct select SensitiveInfo:' AS Access, SensitiveInfo FROM dbo.CustomerData;
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
    PRINT 'LimitedAppUser failed direct select: ' + ERROR_MESSAGE();
END CATCH;
REVERT;
GO
```

**Example 1: Signing a Stored Procedure with a Certificate**

```sql
USE SignatureDemoDB;
GO

PRINT '--- Example 1: Signing a Stored Procedure with a Certificate ---';

-- A. Create a Certificate for signing
CREATE CERTIFICATE DataUpdaterCert
WITH SUBJECT = 'Certificate for signing data update procedures';
GO
PRINT 'Certificate DataUpdaterCert created.';

-- B. Grant SELECT permission on the SensitiveInfo column to the Certificate
--    Crucial: Permissions are granted to the *certificate*, not the user.
GRANT SELECT ON OBJECT::dbo.CustomerData(SensitiveInfo) TO DataUpdaterCert;
PRINT 'Granted SELECT on CustomerData(SensitiveInfo) to DataUpdaterCert.';

-- C. Create a stored procedure that accesses the sensitive column
CREATE PROCEDURE GetCustomerSensitiveInfo
    @CustomerID INT
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT CustomerName, SensitiveInfo
    FROM dbo.CustomerData
    WHERE CustomerID = @CustomerID;
END;
GO
PRINT 'Stored Procedure GetCustomerSensitiveInfo created.';

-- D. Open the Database Master Key (required to use the private key of DataUpdaterCert)
OPEN MASTER KEY DECRYPTION BY PASSWORD = 'MyStrongDMKPassword!1';
GO
PRINT 'Database Master Key opened.';

-- E. ADD SIGNATURE to the stored procedure using the certificate
ADD SIGNATURE TO OBJECT :: dbo.GetCustomerSensitiveInfo BY CERTIFICATE DataUpdaterCert;
GO
PRINT 'Stored Procedure GetCustomerSensitiveInfo signed by DataUpdaterCert.';

-- F. Close the Database Master Key (security best practice)
CLOSE MASTER KEY;
GO
PRINT 'Database Master Key closed.';

-- G. Grant ONLY EXECUTE permission on the procedure to LimitedAppUser
GRANT EXECUTE ON OBJECT::dbo.GetCustomerSensitiveInfo TO LimitedAppUser;
PRINT 'Granted EXECUTE on GetCustomerSensitiveInfo to LimitedAppUser.';

-- H. Test as LimitedAppUser
--    LimitedAppUser has no direct SELECT on SensitiveInfo, but should succeed via signed procedure.
EXECUTE AS USER = 'LimitedAppUser';
BEGIN TRY
    PRINT 'LimitedAppUser executing GetCustomerSensitiveInfo (should succeed):';
    EXEC dbo.GetCustomerSensitiveInfo @CustomerID = 1;
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
    PRINT 'LimitedAppUser failed executing signed procedure: ' + ERROR_MESSAGE();
END CATCH;
REVERT;
GO
```

**Example 2: Verifying Signature Integrity (Tampering Prevention)**

```sql
USE SignatureDemoDB;
GO

PRINT '--- Example 2: Verifying Signature Integrity (Tampering Prevention) ---';

-- Query signature status (1 = signed, 0 = not signed)
SELECT
    OBJECT_NAME(major_id) AS SignedObject,
    p.class_desc,
    s.crypt_type_desc AS SigningMethod,
    c.name AS SigningCertificate
FROM sys.crypt_properties s
JOIN sys.certificates c ON s.thumbprint = c.thumbprint
WHERE major_id = OBJECT_ID('dbo.GetCustomerSensitiveInfo');
GO

-- Modify the procedure (this will break the signature)
ALTER PROCEDURE GetCustomerSensitiveInfo
    @CustomerID INT
AS
BEGIN
    -- Added a comment to alter the procedure
    SELECT CustomerName, SensitiveInfo
    FROM dbo.CustomerData
    WHERE CustomerID = @CustomerID;
END;
GO
PRINT 'Stored Procedure GetCustomerSensitiveInfo ALTERED (signature now invalid).';

-- Test as LimitedAppUser again (should fail)
-- Because the signature is now invalid, the procedure will try to run
-- with the caller's permissions, which are insufficient.
EXECUTE AS USER = 'LimitedAppUser';
BEGIN TRY
    PRINT 'LimitedAppUser executing ALTERED GetCustomerSensitiveInfo (should fail):';
    EXEC dbo.GetCustomerSensitiveInfo @CustomerID = 1;
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
    PRINT 'LimitedAppUser failed executing ALTERED procedure (signature invalid): ' + ERROR_MESSAGE();
END CATCH;
REVERT;
GO

-- You can also check crypt_properties for invalid signatures directly
SELECT
    OBJECT_NAME(major_id) AS SignedObject,
    p.class_desc,
    s.crypt_type_desc AS SigningMethod,
    c.name AS SigningCertificate,
    CASE WHEN s.signature IS NOT NULL THEN 'Signed' ELSE 'Not Signed' END AS SignatureStatus,
    SIGNATURE_VERIFY(s.class, s.major_id, s.crypt_type, s.thumbprint, s.signature) AS SignatureValid -- 1 if valid, 0 if invalid
FROM sys.crypt_properties s
JOIN sys.certificates c ON s.thumbprint = c.thumbprint
WHERE major_id = OBJECT_ID('dbo.GetCustomerSensitiveInfo');
GO
```

**Example 3: Dropping a Signature**

```sql
USE SignatureDemoDB;
GO

PRINT '--- Example 3: Dropping a Signature ---';

-- Re-sign the procedure to make it valid for the demo
OPEN MASTER KEY DECRYPTION BY PASSWORD = 'MyStrongDMKPassword!1';
ADD SIGNATURE TO OBJECT :: dbo.GetCustomerSensitiveInfo BY CERTIFICATE DataUpdaterCert;
CLOSE MASTER KEY;
PRINT 'Procedure re-signed.';

-- Verify signature is now valid
SELECT OBJECT_NAME(major_id) AS SignedObject, SIGNATURE_VERIFY(s.class, s.major_id, s.crypt_type, s.thumbprint, s.signature) AS SignatureValid
FROM sys.crypt_properties s
WHERE major_id = OBJECT_ID('dbo.GetCustomerSensitiveInfo');
GO

-- Now, DROP the signature
DROP SIGNATURE FROM OBJECT :: dbo.GetCustomerSensitiveInfo BY CERTIFICATE DataUpdaterCert;
GO
PRINT 'Signature dropped from GetCustomerSensitiveInfo.';

-- Verify signature is gone
SELECT major_id FROM sys.crypt_properties WHERE major_id = OBJECT_ID('dbo.GetCustomerSensitiveInfo');
-- Expected: No rows
GO

-- Test as LimitedAppUser again (should fail, as signed permissions are gone)
EXECUTE AS USER = 'LimitedAppUser';
BEGIN TRY
    PRINT 'LimitedAppUser executing GetCustomerSensitiveInfo after signature drop (should fail):';
    EXEC dbo.GetCustomerSensitiveInfo @CustomerID = 1;
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
    PRINT 'LimitedAppUser failed after signature drop: ' + ERROR_MESSAGE();
END CATCH;
REVERT;
GO
```

**Cleanup:**

```sql
USE master;
GO

-- Drop logins
IF LOGIN_ID('LimitedAppUserLogin') IS NOT NULL DROP LOGIN LimitedAppUserLogin;
GO

-- Drop database (this implicitly drops users, tables, procedures, certificates, and the DMK)
DROP DATABASE SignatureDemoDB;
GO

PRINT 'All demo objects cleaned up.';
```

`ADD SIGNATURE` is a powerful tool for implementing a "trusted subsystem" or "constrained delegation" security model in SQL Server. It allows administrators to grant specific, elevated permissions to a piece of code (a module) rather than directly to the user, ensuring that users only have the necessary privileges when executing that specific, controlled logic. Understanding module signing is a mark of a strong security-aware SQL Server professional.
