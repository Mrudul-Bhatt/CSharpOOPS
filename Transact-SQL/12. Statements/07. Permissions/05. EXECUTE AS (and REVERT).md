Let's dive deeply into `EXECUTE AS` and `REVERT` in Transact-SQL. These statements are fundamental to managing the execution context in SQL Server, which is a cornerstone of its robust security model, particularly regarding permissions and ownership chaining.

### `EXECUTE AS` (and `REVERT`) - Deep Dive

The `EXECUTE AS` clause or statement allows you to temporarily change the security context under which a batch, stored procedure, function, or trigger executes. This means that for the duration of the `EXECUTE AS` context, the permissions of the *impersonated* principal are used, rather than the permissions of the *original caller*. `REVERT` is then used to switch back to the original security context.

#### Purpose and Importance

1.  **Ownership Chaining:** This is the primary problem `EXECUTE AS OWNER` (the default for procedures) solves. When one database object (e.g., a stored procedure) accesses another object (e.g., a table), SQL Server typically checks permissions only on the *entry point* (the procedure). If the owner of the procedure is the same as the owner of the table, permissions on the table are *not* checked for the calling user. `EXECUTE AS` extends this concept to allow specific, controlled access.
2.  **Least Privilege:** Enables granting a user minimal permissions. Instead of granting a user direct `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` permissions on underlying tables, you can grant them only `EXECUTE` permission on a stored procedure. The procedure, when executed under a different context (e.g., as its owner, or a specific user), can then perform the necessary operations with the higher permissions. This is a best practice for secure application design.
3.  **Encapsulation:** By encapsulating data access logic within stored procedures and using `EXECUTE AS`, you can centralize security logic and make it easier to manage and audit.
4.  **Flexible Security:** Allows dynamic adjustment of permissions based on specific application logic or user roles.
5.  **Debugging/Testing:** Useful for testing permission scenarios by impersonating different users or logins.

#### Key Concepts

* **Execution Context:** The security identity under which SQL Server evaluates permissions for an operation.
* **Caller:** The original user or login who initiated the batch or procedure call.
* **Impersonated Principal:** The user or login whose permissions are temporarily adopted.
* **Ownership Chaining:** When an object (like a stored procedure) that queries another object (like a table) shares the same owner as the queried object, SQL Server only checks permissions on the calling object (the procedure). This chain of ownership simplifies permission management by avoiding redundant checks. `EXECUTE AS` can break or extend this chain.

#### Forms of `EXECUTE AS`

1.  **`EXECUTE AS CALLER` (Default for functions/views, can be specified for procs):**
    * The code executes under the security context of the principal who called the module. Permissions are checked against the caller's rights.
    * Explicitly specifying this for a procedure overrides the default `EXECUTE AS OWNER`.

2.  **`EXECUTE AS OWNER` (Default for stored procedures and DML triggers):**
    * The code executes under the security context of the owner of the module (the user who created it, or whose login owns the schema).
    * This enables ownership chaining. The caller only needs `EXECUTE` permission on the procedure, not on the underlying objects accessed by the procedure, as long as they are owned by the same user.

3.  **`EXECUTE AS USER = 'user_name'` (Database Scope):**
    * The code executes under the security context of a specified database user.
    * The specified user must exist in the current database.
    * Used when you want to impersonate a specific user's permissions within the current database.

4.  **`EXECUTE AS LOGIN = 'login_name'` (Server Scope):**
    * The code executes under the security context of a specified SQL Server login.
    * The specified login must exist at the server level.
    * Used when you need to impersonate a specific login's permissions for operations that span databases or involve server-level securables.

#### `REVERT`

* Used to stop the impersonation and switch back to the original security context that was active *before* the `EXECUTE AS` statement.
* Every `EXECUTE AS` statement should ideally be matched with a `REVERT` to ensure the security context is reset correctly. If not, the impersonated context might persist longer than intended, which can be a security risk.

#### Permissions Required

* **To specify `EXECUTE AS` in a module (procedure, function, trigger):** You need `IMPERSONATE` permission on the principal specified in `EXECUTE AS` clause, and `ALTER` permission on the module itself. If you're using `EXECUTE AS SELF` or `OWNER` (which defaults to the creator), you don't need explicit `IMPERSONATE`.
* **To execute a batch with `EXECUTE AS`:** You need `IMPERSONATE` permission on the specified login/user.

#### Security Considerations

* **Use with Caution:** While powerful for security, `EXECUTE AS` can be dangerous if misused. Granting `IMPERSONATE` permission to a broad group or using `EXECUTE AS 'dbo'` can bypass security checks.
* **Explicit `REVERT`:** Always pair `EXECUTE AS` with `REVERT` in ad-hoc batches or scripts. Modules (procedures, functions, triggers) automatically revert the context when they complete, but explicit `REVERT` is good practice for clarity and to handle early exits.
* **Auditability:** When `EXECUTE AS` is used, system functions like `SUSER_SNAME()` and `ORIGINAL_LOGIN()` still return the original caller's information, while `CURRENT_USER` and `USER_NAME()` return the impersonated identity. This helps in auditing.

#### Code Examples

**Setup:**

```sql
USE master;
GO

-- Clean up previous demo objects if they exist
IF DB_ID('ExecuteAsDemoDB') IS NOT NULL DROP DATABASE ExecuteAsDemoDB;
IF LOGIN_ID('AppLogin') IS NOT NULL DROP LOGIN AppLogin;
IF LOGIN_ID('LimitedUserLogin') IS NOT NULL DROP LOGIN LimitedUserLogin;
IF LOGIN_ID('DBAdminLogin') IS NOT NULL DROP LOGIN DBAdminLogin;
GO

-- Create a demo database
CREATE DATABASE ExecuteAsDemoDB;
GO
USE ExecuteAsDemoDB;
GO

PRINT 'ExecuteAsDemoDB created.';

-- Create logins and users
CREATE LOGIN AppLogin WITH PASSWORD = 'Password123!', CHECK_EXPIRATION = OFF, CHECK_POLICY = OFF;
CREATE LOGIN LimitedUserLogin WITH PASSWORD = 'Password123!', CHECK_EXPIRATION = OFF, CHECK_POLICY = OFF;
CREATE LOGIN DBAdminLogin WITH PASSWORD = 'Password123!', CHECK_EXPIRATION = OFF, CHECK_POLICY = OFF; -- Login for user that creates procedure

CREATE USER AppUser FOR LOGIN AppLogin;
CREATE USER LimitedUser FOR LOGIN LimitedUserLogin;
CREATE USER DBAdminUser FOR LOGIN DBAdminLogin; -- User for DBAdminLogin
GO

PRINT 'Logins and users created.';

-- Grant DBAdminUser db_owner role for creating objects (typical scenario for proc owner)
EXEC sp_addrolemember 'db_owner', 'DBAdminUser';
GO

-- Create tables
CREATE TABLE SensitiveData (
    ID INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1,1),
    SecretValue NVARCHAR(100),
    LastAccessed DATETIME DEFAULT GETDATE()
);

CREATE TABLE PublicReports (
    ReportID INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1,1),
    ReportName NVARCHAR(100),
    ReportData NVARCHAR(MAX)
);

INSERT INTO SensitiveData (SecretValue) VALUES ('Confidential Data A'), ('Top Secret B');
INSERT INTO PublicReports (ReportName, ReportData) VALUES ('Monthly Sales', 'Detailed Sales Report Data');
GO

PRINT 'Tables created and populated.';
```

**Example 1: `EXECUTE AS USER = 'user_name'` (Statement-Level Impersonation)**

This is for ad-hoc batches or scripts where you need to temporarily switch context.

```sql
USE ExecuteAsDemoDB;
GO

PRINT '--- Example 1: EXECUTE AS USER (Statement) ---';

-- Grant SELECT on PublicReports to LimitedUser (for comparison)
GRANT SELECT ON dbo.PublicReports TO LimitedUser;
PRINT 'Granted SELECT on PublicReports to LimitedUser.';

-- DENY SELECT on SensitiveData to LimitedUser
DENY SELECT ON dbo.SensitiveData TO LimitedUser;
PRINT 'Denied SELECT on SensitiveData to LimitedUser.';

-- Test as LimitedUser (should only see PublicReports)
EXECUTE AS USER = 'LimitedUser';
BEGIN TRY
    SELECT 'LimitedUser querying PublicReports (should succeed):' AS Caller, * FROM dbo.PublicReports;
    SELECT 'LimitedUser querying SensitiveData (should fail):' AS Caller, * FROM dbo.SensitiveData;
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
    PRINT 'LimitedUser failed to query SensitiveData: ' + ERROR_MESSAGE();
END CATCH;
REVERT;
GO

-- Now, use EXECUTE AS to run the query on SensitiveData as AppUser
-- (assuming AppUser has permissions or AppUser is the owner of SensitiveData)
-- Let's grant AppUser SELECT on SensitiveData for this demo
GRANT SELECT ON dbo.SensitiveData TO AppUser;
PRINT 'Granted SELECT on SensitiveData to AppUser.';

PRINT 'Impersonating AppUser to query SensitiveData...';
EXECUTE AS USER = 'AppUser'; -- Impersonate AppUser
BEGIN TRY
    -- Inside this block, permissions are evaluated for AppUser
    SELECT 'Querying SensitiveData AS AppUser (should succeed):' AS ImpersonatedUser, * FROM dbo.SensitiveData;
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
    PRINT 'Failed while impersonating AppUser: ' + ERROR_MESSAGE();
END CATCH;
REVERT; -- Switch back to original context (e.g., 'dbo' or your current login)
PRINT 'Reverted to original context.';

-- Verify that the original user cannot access SensitiveData
SELECT 'Original user querying SensitiveData (should fail if not granted):' AS OriginalUser, * FROM dbo.SensitiveData;
GO
```

**Example 2: `EXECUTE AS LOGIN = 'login_name'` (Statement-Level for Server Scope)**

```sql
USE master; -- Server-level operations need master context
GO

PRINT '--- Example 2: EXECUTE AS LOGIN (Statement) ---';

-- Grant VIEW ANY DATABASE permission to AppLogin
GRANT VIEW ANY DATABASE TO AppLogin;
PRINT 'Granted VIEW ANY DATABASE to AppLogin.';

-- Test as AppLogin (should see database names)
EXECUTE AS LOGIN = 'AppLogin';
BEGIN TRY
    SELECT 'AppLogin viewing databases (should succeed):' AS ImpersonatedLogin, name FROM sys.databases;
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
    PRINT 'AppLogin failed: ' + ERROR_MESSAGE();
END CATCH;
REVERT;
GO

-- Assume your current login doesn't have CREATE DATABASE permission
-- EXECUTE AS LOGIN to create a database
PRINT 'Impersonating DBAdminLogin to create a database...';
EXECUTE AS LOGIN = 'DBAdminLogin'; -- Assuming DBAdminLogin has CREATE DATABASE server permission or is sysadmin
BEGIN TRY
    CREATE DATABASE ImpersonatedDB;
    PRINT 'DBAdminLogin successfully created ImpersonatedDB.';
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
    PRINT 'Failed to create database as DBAdminLogin: ' + ERROR_MESSAGE();
END CATCH;
REVERT;
PRINT 'Reverted to original context.';

-- Clean up
DROP DATABASE ImpersonatedDB;
REVOKE VIEW ANY DATABASE FROM AppLogin;
GO
```

**Example 3: `EXECUTE AS OWNER` (Module-Level Impersonation - Default for Procs)**

```sql
USE ExecuteAsDemoDB;
GO

PRINT '--- Example 3: EXECUTE AS OWNER (Module) ---';

-- Create a stored procedure (owned by DBAdminUser, who has db_owner)
-- By default, this will EXECUTE AS OWNER (DBAdminUser).
-- DBAdminUser has permissions on SensitiveData and PublicReports.
CREATE PROCEDURE GetSensitiveReportData
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT ID, SecretValue FROM dbo.SensitiveData;
    SELECT ReportID, ReportName FROM dbo.PublicReports;
END;
GO
PRINT 'Stored Procedure GetSensitiveReportData created (owned by DBAdminUser).';

-- Verify procedure owner (if not specified, it's the creating user's default schema owner)
-- For clarity, let's explicitly change owner to DBAdminUser if it wasn't
ALTER AUTHORIZATION ON OBJECT::dbo.GetSensitiveReportData TO DBAdminUser;
PRINT 'Owner of GetSensitiveReportData set to DBAdminUser.';

-- Grant only EXECUTE permission on the procedure to LimitedUser
GRANT EXECUTE ON dbo.GetSensitiveReportData TO LimitedUser;
PRINT 'Granted EXECUTE on GetSensitiveReportData to LimitedUser.';

-- Test as LimitedUser
-- LimitedUser does NOT have direct SELECT on SensitiveData (DENY was applied earlier and not revoked yet)
-- But, through ownership chaining (EXECUTE AS OWNER), it should succeed.
EXECUTE AS USER = 'LimitedUser';
BEGIN TRY
    PRINT 'LimitedUser executing GetSensitiveReportData:';
    EXEC dbo.GetSensitiveReportData; -- This should succeed via ownership chaining
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
    PRINT 'LimitedUser failed to execute GetSensitiveReportData: ' + ERROR_MESSAGE();
END CATCH;
REVERT;
GO
```

**Example 4: `EXECUTE AS SELF` (Module-Level Impersonation)**

`EXECUTE AS SELF` means the module executes as the principal who created it. This is practically the same as `EXECUTE AS OWNER` if the creator is the owner, but explicitly states the intent.

```sql
USE ExecuteAsDemoDB;
GO

PRINT '--- Example 4: EXECUTE AS SELF (Module) ---';

-- Create another procedure, explicitly setting EXECUTE AS SELF
CREATE PROCEDURE GetPublicReportSummary
WITH EXECUTE AS SELF
AS
BEGIN
    -- This procedure runs with the permissions of DBAdminUser (the creator)
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS TotalReports FROM dbo.PublicReports;
END;
GO
PRINT 'Stored Procedure GetPublicReportSummary created (EXECUTE AS SELF).';

-- Grant EXECUTE to LimitedUser
GRANT EXECUTE ON dbo.GetPublicReportSummary TO LimitedUser;
PRINT 'Granted EXECUTE on GetPublicReportSummary to LimitedUser.';

-- Test as LimitedUser (should succeed)
EXECUTE AS USER = 'LimitedUser';
BEGIN TRY
    PRINT 'LimitedUser executing GetPublicReportSummary:';
    EXEC dbo.GetPublicReportSummary;
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
    PRINT 'LimitedUser failed: ' + ERROR_MESSAGE();
END CATCH;
REVERT;
GO
```

**Example 5: `EXECUTE AS CALLER` (Module-Level Impersonation)**

This explicitly forces the procedure to run using the caller's permissions, even if ownership chaining might otherwise apply.

```sql
USE ExecuteAsDemoDB;
GO

PRINT '--- Example 5: EXECUTE AS CALLER (Module) ---';

-- Create a procedure with EXECUTE AS CALLER
CREATE PROCEDURE AttemptSensitiveUpdate
WITH EXECUTE AS CALLER
AS
BEGIN
    -- This procedure runs with the permissions of the user calling it.
    -- If LimitedUser calls it, LimitedUser's permissions are used.
    UPDATE dbo.SensitiveData SET LastAccessed = GETDATE() WHERE ID = 1;
END;
GO
PRINT 'Stored Procedure AttemptSensitiveUpdate created (EXECUTE AS CALLER).';

-- Grant EXECUTE to LimitedUser
GRANT EXECUTE ON dbo.AttemptSensitiveUpdate TO LimitedUser;
PRINT 'Granted EXECUTE on AttemptSensitiveUpdate to LimitedUser.';

-- Test as LimitedUser (should fail, as LimitedUser does not have UPDATE on SensitiveData)
EXECUTE AS USER = 'LimitedUser';
BEGIN TRY
    PRINT 'LimitedUser executing AttemptSensitiveUpdate (should fail):';
    EXEC dbo.AttemptSensitiveUpdate;
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
    PRINT 'LimitedUser failed to update SensitiveData (due to EXECUTE AS CALLER): ' + ERROR_MESSAGE();
END CATCH;
REVERT;
GO
```

**Example 6: Using `SUSER_SNAME()`, `ORIGINAL_LOGIN()`, `CURRENT_USER`, `USER_NAME()` for Auditing**

```sql
USE ExecuteAsDemoDB;
GO

PRINT '--- Example 6: Auditing with EXECUTE AS ---';

CREATE PROCEDURE ShowContext
WITH EXECUTE AS 'AppUser' -- Explicitly run as AppUser
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT
        'Original Login (SQL Login Name):' AS ContextInfo, SUSER_SNAME() AS Value
    UNION ALL
    SELECT
        'Original User (DB User Name):', ORIGINAL_LOGIN()
    UNION ALL
    SELECT
        'Current User (Impersonated DB User Name):', CURRENT_USER
    UNION ALL
    SELECT
        'User Name (Impersonated DB User Name):', USER_NAME();
END;
GO
PRINT 'Stored Procedure ShowContext created.';

-- Grant EXECUTE to LimitedUser (so LimitedUser can call it)
GRANT EXECUTE ON dbo.ShowContext TO LimitedUser;
GO

-- Execute as LimitedUser, but the procedure will run as AppUser
EXECUTE AS USER = 'LimitedUser';
BEGIN TRY
    PRINT 'Executing ShowContext as LimitedUser, but procedure runs as AppUser:';
    EXEC dbo.ShowContext;
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
    PRINT 'Failed: ' + ERROR_MESSAGE();
END CATCH;
REVERT;
GO
```

**Cleanup:**

```sql
USE master;
GO

-- Drop logins first
USE ExecuteAsDemoDB;
GO
DROP TABLE SensitiveData;
DROP TABLE PublicReports;
DROP PROCEDURE GetSensitiveReportData;
DROP PROCEDURE GetPublicReportSummary;
DROP PROCEDURE AttemptSensitiveUpdate;
DROP PROCEDURE ShowContext;

-- Remove from role
EXEC sp_droprolemember 'db_owner', 'DBAdminUser';
DROP USER AppUser;
DROP USER LimitedUser;
DROP USER DBAdminUser;
GO

-- Drop database
USE master;
GO
DROP DATABASE ExecuteAsDemoDB;
GO

-- Drop logins
DROP LOGIN AppLogin;
DROP LOGIN LimitedUserLogin;
DROP LOGIN DBAdminLogin;
GO

PRINT 'All demo objects cleaned up.';
```

`EXECUTE AS` and `REVERT` are powerful tools for managing security contexts in SQL Server. They are essential for implementing the principle of least privilege, building secure applications that abstract direct table permissions, and managing complex security scenarios. A solid understanding of `EXECUTE AS` and its different forms, along with the implications of ownership chaining, is critical for any SQL Server professional.
