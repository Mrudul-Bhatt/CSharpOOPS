Here's a **detailed explanation** of the article **"FROM clause plus JOIN, APPLY, PIVOT (Transact-SQL)"** from Microsoft Docs for **SQL Server (Transact-SQL)**, with practical examples to help you understand each concept clearly.

---

## ðŸ§© Overview

In SQL Server, the `FROM` clause is **not just for specifying tables**â€”it's also where you:

* Combine tables (`JOIN`)
* Call table-valued functions (`APPLY`)
* Transform data structures (`PIVOT` and `UNPIVOT`)

---

## ðŸ”¸ 1. `FROM` Clause

### âž¤ Purpose:

Specifies the **source of the data** for the `SELECT` query. This could be:

* A single table
* Multiple tables joined together
* A derived table or subquery
* A function
* A view

---

### âž¤ Basic Example:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Employees;
```

> Fetches all rows from the `Employees` table.

---

## ðŸ”¸ 2. `JOIN` Types

Used to **combine rows** from two or more tables based on a related column.

### âž¤ a) `INNER JOIN`:

Returns only matching rows from both tables.

```sql
SELECT e.EmployeeID, e.Name, d.DepartmentName
FROM Employees e
INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID;
```

---

### âž¤ b) `LEFT JOIN` (or `LEFT OUTER JOIN`):

Returns **all rows from the left** table and matching rows from the right table.

```sql
SELECT e.EmployeeID, e.Name, d.DepartmentName
FROM Employees e
LEFT JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID;
```

---

### âž¤ c) `RIGHT JOIN`:

Returns **all rows from the right** table and matching rows from the left.

```sql
SELECT e.EmployeeID, e.Name, d.DepartmentName
FROM Employees e
RIGHT JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID;
```

---

### âž¤ d) `FULL JOIN` (or `FULL OUTER JOIN`):

Returns **all rows from both** tables, with NULLs where there is no match.

```sql
SELECT e.EmployeeID, d.DepartmentName
FROM Employees e
FULL JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID;
```

---

## ðŸ”¸ 3. `APPLY` Operator

Used to **invoke a table-valued function** for each row of the outer table.

There are two types:

* `CROSS APPLY`
* `OUTER APPLY`

### âž¤ a) `CROSS APPLY`:

Only returns rows where the function returns data (like INNER JOIN).

```sql
SELECT e.EmployeeID, f.ProjectName
FROM Employees e
CROSS APPLY GetProjects(e.EmployeeID) f;
```

---

### âž¤ b) `OUTER APPLY`:

Returns all rows from the outer table, even if the function returns NULL (like LEFT JOIN).

```sql
SELECT e.EmployeeID, f.ProjectName
FROM Employees e
OUTER APPLY GetProjects(e.EmployeeID) f;
```

---

## ðŸ”¸ 4. `PIVOT`

Transforms **row data into columns**.

### âž¤ Example â€“ Pivoting sales by quarter:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM (
  SELECT EmployeeID, Quarter, SalesAmount
  FROM Sales
) AS SourceTable
PIVOT (
  SUM(SalesAmount)
  FOR Quarter IN ([Q1], [Q2], [Q3], [Q4])
) AS PivotTable;
```

> You get one row per `EmployeeID`, and columns for `Q1`, `Q2`, `Q3`, `Q4`.

---

## ðŸ”¸ 5. `UNPIVOT`

Does the **reverse of PIVOT**: transforms columns into rows.

### âž¤ Example:

```sql
SELECT EmployeeID, Quarter, SalesAmount
FROM
(
  SELECT EmployeeID, Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4
  FROM QuarterlySales
) p
UNPIVOT (
  SalesAmount FOR Quarter IN (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4)
) AS UnpivotTable;
```

> You get rows like:
> EmployeeID: 101, Quarter: Q1, SalesAmount: 5000

| Feature   | Description                                          | Analogy                       |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `JOIN`    | Combines rows from two tables based on a condition   | Merging tables                |
| `APPLY`   | Calls a table-valued function per row of outer table | Per-row sub-query             |
| `PIVOT`   | Rotates rows into columns                            | Transpose data (row â†’ column) |
| `UNPIVOT` | Rotates columns into rows                            | Transpose data (column â†’ row) |

## âœ… Use Cases

| Goal                           | Use This  |
| ------------------------------ | --------- |
| Join data from multiple tables | `JOIN`    |
| Call a function for each row   | `APPLY`   |
| Convert row values to columns  | `PIVOT`   |
| Convert columns to row values  | `UNPIVOT` |
