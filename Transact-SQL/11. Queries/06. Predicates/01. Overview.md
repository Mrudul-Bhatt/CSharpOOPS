Hereâ€™s a **detailed explanation** of the Microsoft Docs article **"Predicates (Transact-SQL)"** for **SQL Server**, along with examples to help clarify how they're used.

---

## ðŸ”· What Is a Predicate?

A **predicate** in T-SQL is a condition that **evaluates to TRUE, FALSE, or UNKNOWN**. It's used in clauses like:

* `WHERE`
* `ON`
* `HAVING`
* `JOIN`
* `CHECK` constraints
* `IF` and `CASE` expressions

Predicates **determine which rows meet a condition** in a query or expression.

---

## ðŸ“š Common Types of Predicates in T-SQL

### 1. **Comparison Predicates**

Compare two expressions using standard operators.

**Operators**: `=`, `<>`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`

**Example**:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Salary > 50000;
```

---

### 2. **BETWEEN Predicate**

Checks if a value is within a range (inclusive).

**Syntax**:

```sql
column BETWEEN lower_bound AND upper_bound
```

**Example**:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE OrderDate BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-12-31';
```

---

### 3. **IN Predicate**

Checks if a value matches any value in a list or subquery.

**Example**:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Products WHERE CategoryID IN (1, 2, 3);
```

---

### 4. **LIKE Predicate**

Used for pattern matching with wildcard characters.

* `%` â€“ matches any number of characters
* `_` â€“ matches one character

**Example**:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE CompanyName LIKE 'A%';
```

---

### 5. **IS NULL / IS NOT NULL Predicate**

Tests for NULL (unknown) values.

**Example**:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE ManagerID IS NULL;
```

---

### 6. **EXISTS Predicate**

Checks if a subquery returns any rows.

**Example**:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM Orders WHERE Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID
);
```

---

### 7. **CONTAINS and FREETEXT Predicates**

Used in **full-text search** for matching natural language text.

**Example**:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Articles
WHERE CONTAINS(BodyText, 'database');
```

---

### 8. **ALL, ANY, and SOME Predicates**

Used with subqueries to compare a value to a set of values.

**Example (ANY)**:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Products
WHERE Price > ANY (SELECT Price FROM Products WHERE CategoryID = 1);
```

---

### 9. **Boolean Predicates**

Can return true or false directly.

**Example**:

```sql
IF EXISTS (SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE OrderDate > '2025-01-01')
    PRINT 'Recent orders exist';
```

---

## ðŸ”Ž Evaluation Result: TRUE, FALSE, or UNKNOWN

* If a predicate evaluates to **TRUE**, the row is returned (or action is taken).
* If **FALSE**, the row is skipped (or the condition fails).
* If **UNKNOWN** (usually due to `NULL` values), it's treated like **FALSE** in filters (`WHERE`), but not in constraints like `CHECK`.

## âœ… Use Cases of Predicates

| Clause        | Purpose                         |
| ------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `WHERE`       | Filter rows                     |
| `ON`          | Join conditions                 |
| `HAVING`      | Filter groups after aggregation |
| `CHECK`       | Validate inserted/updated data  |
| `IF` / `CASE` | Branch logic in queries         |

---

## ðŸ§  Tip:

Use **predicate logic** efficiently to make queries more selective and optimize performance by reducing rows early.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Summary

| Predicate Type | Example             |
| -------------- | ------------------- |
| Comparison     | `Salary > 50000`    |
| Range check    | `BETWEEN 10 AND 20` |
| Set match      | `IN (1, 2, 3)`      |
| Pattern match  | `LIKE 'J%'`         |
| NULL check     | `IS NULL`           |
| Subquery check | `EXISTS (...)`      |
