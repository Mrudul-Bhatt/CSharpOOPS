Here's a detailed explanation of the **Microsoft Docs articles** for **Transact-SQL (T-SQL)** predicates:

* `IS DISTINCT FROM`
* `IS NULL`

These are used to evaluate **equality and nullability conditions** in queries.

---

## üî∑ 1. `IS DISTINCT FROM` (Transact-SQL)

### ‚úÖ **Purpose:**

The `IS DISTINCT FROM` predicate **compares two expressions** and returns:

* `TRUE` if they are **different**
* `FALSE` if they are **equal**
* **Treats NULLs as actual values**, so:

  * `NULL IS DISTINCT FROM NULL` ‚Üí **FALSE**
  * `NULL IS DISTINCT FROM 5` ‚Üí **TRUE**

This helps in scenarios where **`NULL = NULL` should be treated as TRUE**, unlike normal SQL behavior (`NULL = NULL` ‚Üí UNKNOWN).

---

### üìå **Syntax:**

```sql
expression1 IS DISTINCT FROM expression2
```

---

### ‚úÖ **Examples:**

#### 1. Compare with possible NULLs:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Employees
WHERE ManagerID IS DISTINCT FROM SupervisorID;
```

> This returns rows where `ManagerID` and `SupervisorID` are **not equal**, even when one of them is NULL.

---

#### 2. Compare with constant:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Orders
WHERE Discount IS DISTINCT FROM 0;
```

> This will include rows where `Discount` is either **not 0** or **is NULL**.

---

### üß† Why Use It?

Normally:

```sql
WHERE column1 <> column2
```

‚Ä¶will **not return rows** where either value is NULL, because `NULL <> NULL` is **UNKNOWN**.

But with:

```sql
WHERE column1 IS DISTINCT FROM column2
```

‚Ä¶you get a **true logical comparison**, even in the presence of NULLs.

---

## üî∑ 2. `IS NULL` (Transact-SQL)

### ‚úÖ **Purpose:**

The `IS NULL` predicate checks whether a column or expression **has no value**.

* Returns `TRUE` if the value is **NULL**
* Returns `FALSE` otherwise

---

### üìå **Syntax:**

```sql
expression IS NULL
```

You can also use:

```sql
expression IS NOT NULL
```

---

### ‚úÖ **Examples:**

#### 1. Find records with missing values:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE ManagerID IS NULL;
```

> Returns employees who do **not report to anyone**.

---

#### 2. Find records where data exists:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE Discount IS NOT NULL;
```

> Returns orders that have a **non-null discount**.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important:

You **cannot** use `=` to check for NULL:

```sql
-- This does NOT work
WHERE ManagerID = NULL  -- ‚ùå always returns FALSE or UNKNOWN
```

Instead, always use:

```sql
WHERE ManagerID IS NULL
```

## üìä Summary Table

| Predicate                 | Description                                  | Handles NULLs Properly? |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `IS DISTINCT FROM`        | Compares two values with NULL-awareness      | ‚úÖ Yes                   |
| `IS NULL` / `IS NOT NULL` | Checks for presence or absence of NULL value | ‚úÖ Yes                   |
| `=` / `<>`                | Standard comparison                          | ‚ùå No (fails with NULLs) |

---

## ‚úÖ Real-World Use Case:

### Compare columns in two versions of a table:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM OldPrices op
JOIN NewPrices np ON op.ProductID = np.ProductID
WHERE op.Price IS DISTINCT FROM np.Price;
```

> Useful in **data comparison**, **audit logs**, or **ETL** pipelines.
