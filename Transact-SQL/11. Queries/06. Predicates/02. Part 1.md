Here's a **detailed explanation** of the Microsoft Docs articles for **`CONTAINS`** and **`FREETEXT`** predicates in **Transact-SQL (T-SQL)**, both of which are part of **full-text search** functionality in **SQL Server**.

These predicates are used to **search textual data** in SQL Server columns that are full-text indexed.

---

## üî∑ 1. `CONTAINS` (Transact-SQL)

### ‚úÖ **Purpose**:

The `CONTAINS` predicate searches for **exact or fuzzy matches** of words or phrases in a **full-text indexed** column.

---

### üìå **Syntax**:

```sql
CONTAINS (column, 'search_condition')
```

* `column`: A full-text indexed column.
* `'search_condition'`: A string that describes what to search for. It can contain:

  * Words or phrases
  * Boolean operators (`AND`, `OR`, `AND NOT`)
  * Wildcards (`*`)
  * Inflectional forms (`FORMSOF`)

---

### ‚úÖ **Examples**:

#### 1. Search for a single word

```sql
SELECT * FROM Articles
WHERE CONTAINS(Body, 'database');
```

#### 2. Search for a phrase

```sql
SELECT * FROM Articles
WHERE CONTAINS(Body, '"relational database"');
```

#### 3. Use `OR` to search for multiple terms

```sql
SELECT * FROM Articles
WHERE CONTAINS(Body, 'SQL OR NoSQL');
```

#### 4. Inflectional form (e.g., "drive", "drives", "driven")

```sql
SELECT * FROM Articles
WHERE CONTAINS(Body, 'FORMSOF(INFLECTIONAL, drive)');
```

#### 5. Wildcard match

```sql
SELECT * FROM Products
WHERE CONTAINS(Description, 'comput*');
```

> üîç This will match "computer", "computing", etc.

---

### üö´ Requirements:

* The target column must be part of a **full-text index**.
* Not available in temp tables or memory-optimized tables.

---

## üî∑ 2. `FREETEXT` (Transact-SQL)

### ‚úÖ **Purpose**:

The `FREETEXT` predicate performs a **natural language search** for values that **conceptually match** the meaning of a word or phrase. It is **less strict** than `CONTAINS`.

---

### üìå **Syntax**:

```sql
FREETEXT (column, 'search_text')
```

* `column`: Must be full-text indexed.
* `'search_text'`: Text string to match using natural language interpretation.

---

### ‚úÖ **Examples**:

#### 1. Basic FREETEXT search

```sql
SELECT * FROM Articles
WHERE FREETEXT(Body, 'artificial intelligence');
```

> üîç Finds matches like ‚ÄúAI‚Äù, ‚Äúmachine learning‚Äù, or ‚Äúneural networks‚Äù if they are contextually similar.

#### 2. With multiple words

```sql
SELECT * FROM Products
WHERE FREETEXT(Description, 'compact camera with zoom');
```

> This may return products with similar phrases like "zooming digital camera" or "portable lens camera".

### ‚öñÔ∏è `CONTAINS` vs `FREETEXT`

| Feature            | `CONTAINS`               | `FREETEXT`              |
| ------------------ | ------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Type               | Exact/full-text search   | Natural language search |
| Flexibility        | Precise, customizable    | Looser, meaning-based   |
| Supports wildcards | ‚úÖ Yes                    | ‚ùå No                    |
| Inflectional forms | ‚úÖ Via `FORMSOF`          | ‚úÖ Automatically applied |
| Query control      | High (`AND`, `OR`, etc.) | Low (simplified input)  |

---

### üß† Notes:

* Both require that the column is part of a **full-text index**.
* These are **not regular `LIKE` searches**. They rely on a **separate full-text engine** in SQL Server.
* Use these when searching through large text documents, product descriptions, articles, comments, etc.

| Predicate  | Use When You Need To‚Ä¶                     | Example Use Case                          |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `CONTAINS` | Find specific words, phrases, or patterns | Search ‚Äúexact phrase‚Äù or ‚Äúcomput\*‚Äù       |
