Here's a detailed explanation of the two articles from the **Microsoft Docs for Transact-SQL (SQL Server)** in the **General Queries** section:

> âœ… `SELECT - GROUP BY`
> âœ… `SELECT - WINDOW Clause`

These are both advanced features for organizing and analyzing result sets, and are central to aggregation and analytics.

## ðŸ”¹ 1. `SELECT â€“ GROUP BY`

### âž¤ Purpose:

The `GROUP BY` clause is used in a `SELECT` query to **aggregate rows** that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows. Itâ€™s typically used with **aggregate functions** like `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MIN()`, `MAX()`.

---

### âž¤ Syntax:

```sql
SELECT column1, aggregate_function(column2)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column1;
```

---

### âž¤ Example 1 â€“ Count students per major:

```sql
SELECT Major, COUNT(*) AS TotalStudents
FROM Students
GROUP BY Major;
```

> This will return one row per `Major`, along with the count of students in that major.

---

### âž¤ Example 2 â€“ Average salary per department:

```sql
SELECT DepartmentID, AVG(Salary) AS AvgSalary
FROM Employees
GROUP BY DepartmentID;
```

---

### âž¤ Example 3 â€“ Using `HAVING` to filter groups:

```sql
SELECT DepartmentID, COUNT(*) AS EmployeeCount
FROM Employees
GROUP BY DepartmentID
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
```

> `HAVING` is like `WHERE`, but for filtering **grouped** results.

---

### âž¤ Notes:

* All columns in the `SELECT` list **must** be either part of the `GROUP BY` clause or used in aggregate functions.
* `GROUP BY ROLLUP` and `GROUPING SETS` allow for advanced summary reports (like subtotals).

---

## ðŸ”¹ 2. `SELECT â€“ WINDOW Clause`

### âž¤ Purpose:

The `WINDOW` clause is used to define a **named window frame** (a subset of rows) that can be reused across multiple **window functions** like `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, `SUM() OVER(...)`, etc.

> Introduced in SQL Server 2012 as part of advanced **analytic/OLAP querying**.

---

### âž¤ Syntax:

```sql
SELECT column1,
       RANK() OVER window_name
FROM table_name
WINDOW window_name AS (PARTITION BY column2 ORDER BY column3);
```

---

### âž¤ Without `WINDOW` Clause:

```sql
SELECT Name,
       RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY DepartmentID ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS DeptRank
FROM Employees;
```

---

### âž¤ With `WINDOW` Clause (for reuse and clarity):

```sql
SELECT Name,
       RANK() OVER emp_window AS DeptRank,
       DENSE_RANK() OVER emp_window AS DenseDeptRank
FROM Employees
WINDOW emp_window AS (PARTITION BY DepartmentID ORDER BY Salary DESC);
```

> You define the window once and apply it to multiple functionsâ€”clearer and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).

---

### âž¤ Example â€“ Cumulative total using `SUM` with `OVER`:

```sql
SELECT EmployeeID, Salary,
       SUM(Salary) OVER (PARTITION BY DepartmentID ORDER BY HireDate) AS RunningTotal
FROM Employees;
```

> This gives a **running total** of salaries per department, ordered by hire date.

## âœ… Summary Table

| Feature         | Purpose                                                               |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GROUP BY`      | Aggregates rows based on column values; used with aggregate functions |
| `WINDOW Clause` | Defines a reusable window frame for analytics (used with OVER clause) |

---

## âœ… When to Use What

| Use Case                                            | Use Feature                        |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Summarize data per group                            | `GROUP BY`                         |
| Show running totals or ranks                        | `WINDOW` clause + window functions |
| Filter summarized results                           | `HAVING` with `GROUP BY`           |
| Apply multiple window functions with the same frame | `WINDOW` clause                    |

Would you like a comparison between `GROUP BY` vs `OVER (PARTITION BY ...)`, or how to use both in a single query for hybrid aggregation and analytics?
