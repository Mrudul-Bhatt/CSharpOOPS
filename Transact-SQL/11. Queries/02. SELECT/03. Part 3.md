Here’s a detailed explanation of the **`SELECT - HAVING`** and **`SELECT - INTO Clause`** articles from the **Microsoft Docs** for **Transact-SQL (T-SQL) – SQL Server**, categorized under **General Queries**:

---

## 🔹 1. `SELECT – HAVING`

### ➤ Purpose:

The `HAVING` clause is used in combination with `GROUP BY` to **filter grouped records** (i.e., aggregate results). While `WHERE` filters rows **before** grouping, `HAVING` filters **after** aggregation.

---

### ➤ Syntax:

```sql
SELECT column1, AGGREGATE_FUNCTION(column2)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column1
HAVING condition;
```

---

### ➤ Example 1 – Filter groups after aggregation:

```sql
SELECT DepartmentID, COUNT(*) AS EmployeeCount
FROM Employees
GROUP BY DepartmentID
HAVING COUNT(*) > 10;
```

> ✅ This returns only departments with more than 10 employees.

---

### ➤ Example 2 – Combine WHERE and HAVING:

```sql
SELECT Major, AVG(GPA) AS AverageGPA
FROM Students
WHERE EnrollmentYear >= 2020
GROUP BY Major
HAVING AVG(GPA) > 3.5;
```

* `WHERE` filters students by enrollment year **before grouping**.
* `HAVING` filters groups by GPA **after grouping**.

---

### ➤ Key Notes:

* `HAVING` **must** refer to aggregate functions or grouped columns.
* Without `GROUP BY`, `HAVING` still works if using aggregate functions (only one group).

---

## 🔹 2. `SELECT – INTO Clause`

### ➤ Purpose:

The `SELECT ... INTO` statement creates a **new table** and inserts the result of a `SELECT` query into it.

> ✅ This is useful for **backups, staging data, or temp tables** without predefining a schema.

---

### ➤ Syntax:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
INTO new_table
FROM existing_table
WHERE condition;
```

> ⚠️ `new_table` **must not already exist**, or SQL Server will throw an error.

---

### ➤ Example 1 – Copy data into a new table:

```sql
SELECT * 
INTO Employees_Backup
FROM Employees
WHERE IsActive = 1;
```

> Creates a new table `Employees_Backup` with the same structure and active employees.

---

### ➤ Example 2 – Select specific columns:

```sql
SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName
INTO NewHires
FROM Employees
WHERE HireDate >= '2024-01-01';
```

---

### ➤ Example 3 – Use joins or complex queries:

```sql
SELECT e.DepartmentID, d.DepartmentName, COUNT(*) AS EmployeeCount
INTO DeptSummary
FROM Employees e
JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
GROUP BY e.DepartmentID, d.DepartmentName;
```

---

### ➤ Notes:

* The **new table inherits column names and data types** from the source query.
* To define constraints, indexes, or keys, you'll need to add them **after** the `SELECT INTO`.
* Works with temporary tables too:

```sql
SELECT * INTO #TempTable FROM SomeTable;
```

## ✅ Summary Table

| Feature       | Purpose                                               | Common Use                                        |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `HAVING`      | Filters aggregate results after `GROUP BY`            | Group-level filtering (e.g., average > 3.0)       |
| `SELECT INTO` | Creates a new table and inserts query results into it | Quick backup, transformation staging, temp tables |

---

## ✅ Key Differences: WHERE vs HAVING

| Clause   | Filters | Used With Aggregates | Example Condition            |
| -------- | ------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `WHERE`  | Rows    | ❌ Not allowed        | `WHERE Salary > 50000`       |
| `HAVING` | Groups  | ✅ Required           | `HAVING AVG(Salary) > 60000` |
