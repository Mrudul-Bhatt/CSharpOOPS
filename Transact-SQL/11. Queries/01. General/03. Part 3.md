Sure! Let’s explore the three features you've asked about from the **Microsoft Docs for Transact-SQL (SQL Server)** under the **General Queries** section:

> ✅ `WITH common_table_expression`
> ✅ `Nested common table expressions in Fabric Warehouse`
> ✅ `WRITETEXT`

---

## 🔹 1. `WITH common_table_expression` (CTE)

### ➤ Purpose:

A **Common Table Expression (CTE)** is a **temporary named result set** that you define within the execution scope of a single `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statement.

### ➤ Syntax:

```sql
WITH cte_name (column1, column2, ...) AS (
    SELECT statement
)
-- Use the CTE
SELECT * FROM cte_name;
```

* The `WITH` clause introduces the CTE.
* It's often used for improving readability, recursive queries, and breaking down complex logic.

---

### ➤ Example 1: Simple CTE

```sql
WITH TopStudents AS (
    SELECT Name, GPA
    FROM Students
    WHERE GPA > 3.5
)
SELECT * FROM TopStudents;
```

---

### ➤ Example 2: Recursive CTE (for hierarchies)

```sql
WITH OrgChart AS (
    SELECT EmployeeID, ManagerID, Name, 0 AS Level
    FROM Employees
    WHERE ManagerID IS NULL
    UNION ALL
    SELECT e.EmployeeID, e.ManagerID, e.Name, Level + 1
    FROM Employees e
    JOIN OrgChart o ON e.ManagerID = o.EmployeeID
)
SELECT * FROM OrgChart;
```

> 🔄 Recursive CTEs are powerful for hierarchical data like organizational structures, file systems, etc.

---

## 🔹 2. Nested Common Table Expressions in Fabric Warehouse

### ➤ Purpose:

In **Microsoft Fabric Warehouse**, you can **nest multiple CTEs** within a single query. Each CTE can reference others declared earlier in the same `WITH` clause.

> 📌 This concept applies to **Microsoft Fabric SQL Engine**, not traditional SQL Server.

### ➤ Syntax:

```sql
WITH cte1 AS (
    SELECT ...
),
cte2 AS (
    SELECT ... FROM cte1
),
cte3 AS (
    SELECT ... FROM cte2
)
SELECT * FROM cte3;
```

---

### ➤ Example: Nested CTEs

```sql
WITH DepartmentAvg AS (
    SELECT DepartmentID, AVG(Salary) AS AvgSalary
    FROM Employees
    GROUP BY DepartmentID
),
HighEarners AS (
    SELECT e.*
    FROM Employees e
    JOIN DepartmentAvg d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
    WHERE e.Salary > d.AvgSalary
),
FinalResult AS (
    SELECT DepartmentID, COUNT(*) AS NumHighEarners
    FROM HighEarners
    GROUP BY DepartmentID
)
SELECT * FROM FinalResult;
```

> ✅ In **Fabric Warehouse**, nesting CTEs improves modularity and complex analysis.

---

## 🔹 3. `WRITETEXT`

### ➤ Purpose:

`WRITETEXT` is used to **replace the entire contents** of a `text`, `ntext`, or `image` column with new data.

> ⚠️ This is a **deprecated feature**. Modern SQL uses `VARCHAR(MAX)` or `VARBINARY(MAX)` with `UPDATE`.

---

### ➤ Syntax:

```sql
WRITETEXT table.column text_pointer new_data
```

* `text_pointer` is a binary reference to the specific text/image/blob column.
* Use `TEXTPTR()` to obtain it.

---

### ➤ Example:

```sql
DECLARE @ptrval BINARY(16);

-- Get the text pointer for the row
SELECT @ptrval = TEXTPTR(TextData)
FROM Articles
WHERE ArticleID = 1;

-- Replace the full text data
WRITETEXT Articles.TextData @ptrval 'New full content for this article';
```

> 🛑 **Avoid in modern development** — instead use:

```sql
UPDATE Articles
SET TextData = 'New full content for this article'
WHERE ArticleID = 1;
```

---

## ✅ Summary Table

| Feature                           | Purpose                                                                 |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `WITH common_table_expression`    | Declares a temporary named result set used within a query               |
| `Nested CTEs in Fabric Warehouse` | Allows referencing one CTE from another in sequence for complex queries |
| `WRITETEXT`                       | Replaces entire `text`, `ntext`, or `image` column content (obsolete)   |

---

Would you like me to show how to convert a `WRITETEXT` usage to `UPDATE` using modern data types, or help design a recursive CTE for a specific use case like bill of materials or org chart?
