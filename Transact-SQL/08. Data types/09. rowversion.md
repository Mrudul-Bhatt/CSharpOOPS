Here is a **point-by-point explanation** of the Microsoft Docs article on **`rowversion (Transact-SQL)`** in SQL Server:

---

### ðŸ”¹ 1. **What Is `rowversion`?**

* `rowversion` is a data type in SQL Server that stores **automatically generated, unique binary numbers**.
* Each time a row with a `rowversion` column is **inserted or updated**, SQL Server assigns a new, incremented `rowversion` value to that row.
* It is used to **version-stamp table rows**, helping track changes over time.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 2. **Key Characteristics**

* **Data Type**: Internally stored as `BINARY(8)`, occupying 8 bytes.
* **Uniqueness**: The `rowversion` value is **unique within the database**.
* **Read-Only**: Cannot be explicitly set or modified; SQL Server manages it automatically.
* **Non-Temporal**: Despite its name, `rowversion` does **not store date or time information**.
* **Synonym**: `timestamp` is a deprecated synonym for `rowversion`; it's recommended to use `rowversion` in new development.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 3. **Usage Scenarios**

* **Optimistic Concurrency Control**: Detect if a row has been modified since it was last read, preventing conflicting updates.
* **Change Tracking**: Identify and synchronize changes in data, especially useful in replication and synchronization scenarios.
* **Snapshot Isolation**: Support for transaction isolation levels that require versioning of rows to maintain consistency.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 4. **Behavior in Operations**

* **Insert**: A new `rowversion` value is generated and assigned.
* **Update**: The `rowversion` value is updated to a new, incremented value.
* **Delete**: The `rowversion` value is not retained after deletion.
* **Select**: Retrieving the `rowversion` value allows applications to track the version of the row.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 5. **System Functions**

* **`@@DBTS`**: Returns the current highest `rowversion` value in the database.

  ```sql
  SELECT @@DBTS;
  ```
* **`MIN_ACTIVE_ROWVERSION()`**: Returns the lowest active `rowversion` value in the database, useful for identifying the earliest active transaction.

  ```sql
  SELECT MIN_ACTIVE_ROWVERSION();
  ```

---

### ðŸ”¹ 6. **Best Practices**

* **Do Not Use as Primary Key**: Since `rowversion` changes with each update, it is unsuitable as a primary key.
* **Avoid Manual Assignment**: Let SQL Server manage `rowversion` values; manual insertion or updates are not allowed.
* **Use for Change Detection**: Incorporate `rowversion` columns to efficiently detect and handle data changes in applications.

### ðŸ”¹ 7. **Example Usage**

```sql
-- Create a table with a rowversion column
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name NVARCHAR(100),
    RowVer ROWVERSION
);

-- Insert a new row
INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, Name) VALUES (1, 'Alice');

-- Retrieve the rowversion value
SELECT EmployeeID, Name, RowVer FROM Employees;

-- Update the row
UPDATE Employees SET Name = 'Alice Smith' WHERE EmployeeID = 1;

-- Retrieve the updated rowversion value
SELECT EmployeeID, Name, RowVer FROM Employees;
```

In this example, the `RowVer` column automatically updates its value each time the row is modified, allowing applications to track changes.
