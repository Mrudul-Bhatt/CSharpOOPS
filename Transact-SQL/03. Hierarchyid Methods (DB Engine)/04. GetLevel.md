Here’s a clear **point-by-point explanation** of the article **“GetLevel (Database Engine)”** from Microsoft Docs for SQL Server — this explains the `GetLevel` method on the `hierarchyid` type.

---

### 🌳 1. **What is `GetLevel`?**

* `GetLevel()` is a **method of the `hierarchyid` data type**.
* It returns the **integer depth level** of the current node in the hierarchy.
* The **root node** has level `0`; its direct children have level `1`, their children have level `2`, and so on.

---

### ⚙️ 2. **Method signature**

```sql
hierarchyid.GetLevel()
```

* No parameters — it’s a simple call.

---

### 📦 3. **Return type**

* Returns an **integer (int)** value.
* The value represents the **hierarchy depth** or **distance from the root**.

---

### 📊 4. **Example usage**

```sql
DECLARE @Position hierarchyid = hierarchyid::Parse('/1/3/5/');
SELECT @Position.GetLevel();  
-- Returns 3, because: root (0) → /1/ (1) → /1/3/ (2) → /1/3/5/ (3)
```

---

### 🌲 5. **Practical use cases**

* Find out **how deep** a node is in the hierarchy.
* Group or filter by level, e.g., **“show only top-level managers”**.
* Format **indentation or display** based on level (for UI).
* Validate or enforce rules like **maximum hierarchy depth**.

---

### ⚡ 6. **Performance notes**

* Very **fast and efficient**, as it’s a built-in function.
* Works well in `WHERE`, `SELECT`, and `ORDER BY` clauses.

---

### 🚦 7. **Important behaviors**

* Root node (`/`) → level `0`.
* First child under root → level `1`.
* Next level → level `2`, and so on.
* Works on both stored hierarchyid columns and variables.

---

### 📌 Example in table

```sql
CREATE TABLE OrgChart (
    EmployeeID int PRIMARY KEY,
    Position hierarchyid,
    Name nvarchar(100)
);

-- Example query: Get all employees and their levels
SELECT Name, Position.ToString() AS Path, Position.GetLevel() AS Level
FROM OrgChart;
```

---

### ✅ 8. **Best practices**

* Use `GetLevel()` when:

  * You need to **filter or group** nodes by depth.
  * You want to **format hierarchy displays**.
  * You need to **validate** inserted nodes stay within a certain depth.
* Combine with `ORDER BY` to **sort from top to bottom**.

### 🔧 Quick summary

| Node Path | `.GetLevel()` Result |
| --------- | -------------------- |
| `/`       | 0                    |
| `/1/`     | 1                    |
| `/1/3/`   | 2                    |
| `/1/3/5/` | 3                    |
