Here’s a **point-by-point explanation** of the article **“Write (Database Engine)”** from Microsoft Docs for SQL Server — this covers the `Write` method of the `hierarchyid` data type.

---

### 🌿 1. **What is `Write`?**

* It’s a method on the `hierarchyid` type.
* It **outputs the binary representation of a hierarchyid value** into a binary stream (such as a `varbinary` or file stream).

---

### ⚙️ 2. **Method signature**

```sql
.Write(binary_writer)
```

* It takes **a BinaryWriter or binary output object** as input.
* It **writes the internal binary form** of the hierarchyid into that stream.

---

### 📦 3. **Return type**

* It **doesn’t return a SQL value**; instead, it **writes bytes directly** to the output stream.
* It’s typically used in **CLR (Common Language Runtime) integration** or C# code that interacts with SQL Server.

---

### 📊 4. **Why is it useful?**

* It allows you to **store or transmit hierarchyid data as compact binary**.
* Useful for:

  * Saving hierarchyid values to files.
  * Sending data over a network.
  * Storing binary snapshots for later reloading.

---

### 🌲 5. **Example usage in C#**

In a SQLCLR (C#) procedure:

```csharp
public void WriteHierarchyId(SqlHierarchyId node, BinaryWriter writer)
{
    node.Write(writer);
}
```

In this example, `node.Write(writer)` writes the binary value of the `hierarchyid` to the given writer (for example, to a file or a memory stream).

---

### ⚡ 6. **Practical use cases**

* **SQL CLR applications** that need to move hierarchyid values in and out of SQL Server.
* Writing hierarchyid values to **binary logs or backup files**.
* Sending hierarchyid values over **binary protocols**.

---

### 🚦 7. **Important behaviors**

* The binary format is **compact and efficient**, but **not human-readable**.
* You usually combine `.Write()` with `.Read()` when transferring data — `.Write()` outputs the value, `.Read()` reads it back.

---

### 📌 Related methods

* **`Read()`** → reads binary into a hierarchyid.
* **`Parse()`** → parses string into a hierarchyid.
* **`ToString()`** → converts hierarchyid to readable string.

---

### ✅ Best practices

* Use `.Write()` **only when you need binary output** (for example, in C# or for export).
* Avoid using `.Write()` in T-SQL unless you’re working in a CLR or binary context.
* For reporting or UI, prefer `.ToString()` over `.Write()`.

### 🔧 Quick summary table

| Method        | Purpose                                 |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `.ToString()` | Get string like `'/1/2/'`               |
| `.Write()`    | Get binary form (for storage/transport) |
| `.Parse()`    | Convert string to hierarchyid           |
| `.Read()`     | Read binary to hierarchyid              |

If you want, I can also:
✅ Provide **a sample C# script using `.Write()`**,
✅ Explain **how to combine `.Write()` and `.Read()`**, or
✅ Show **real SQL CLR examples**.
