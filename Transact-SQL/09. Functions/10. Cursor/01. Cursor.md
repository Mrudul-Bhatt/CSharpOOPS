Here’s a breakdown of **Cursor Functions in Transact-SQL**, based on Microsoft documentation - SQL Server | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/functions/cursor-functions-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver16):

### **1. Overview**
- Cursor functions provide information about cursors in SQL Server.
- These functions are **nondeterministic**, meaning their results can vary each time they execute.

### **2. Available Cursor Functions**
#### **@@CURSOR_ROWS**
- Returns the number of rows in the current cursor.
- If the cursor is dynamic, it returns `-1` since the row count is unknown.
- Example:
  ```sql
  DECLARE myCursor CURSOR FOR SELECT name FROM sys.databases;
  OPEN myCursor;
  SELECT @@CURSOR_ROWS AS CursorRowCount;
  CLOSE myCursor;
  DEALLOCATE myCursor;
  ```

#### **@@FETCH_STATUS**
- Returns the status of the last fetch operation.
- Possible return values:
  - `0` → Fetch successful.
  - `-1` → Fetch failed (beyond result set).
  - `-2` → Fetch failed (cursor not open).
- Example:
  ```sql
  FETCH NEXT FROM myCursor;
  SELECT @@FETCH_STATUS AS FetchStatus;
  ```

#### **CURSOR_STATUS**
- Returns the status of a cursor (whether it is open or closed).
- Can be used for **global** or **local** cursors.
- Example:
  ```sql
  SELECT CURSOR_STATUS('GLOBAL', 'myCursor') AS GlobalCursorStatus;
  SELECT CURSOR_STATUS('LOCAL', 'myCursor') AS LocalCursorStatus;
  ```

### **3. Key Takeaways**
- Cursor functions help track cursor state and behavior.
- They are useful for debugging and handling cursor operations efficiently.
- Since they are **nondeterministic**, their results may change based on execution context.
