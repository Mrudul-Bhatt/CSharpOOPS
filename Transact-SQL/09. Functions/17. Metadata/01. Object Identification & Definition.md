Hereâ€™s a **deep dive** into **Object Identification & Definition Functions** in SQL Server, along with detailed explanations and examples.

---

## **1. OBJECT_ID()**
- **Purpose:** Returns the ID of a database object (table, view, procedure, etc.).
- **Syntax:**
  ```sql
  OBJECT_ID('database.schema.object_name' [, 'object_type'])
  ```
- **Behavior:**
  - If the object exists, it returns its **integer ID**.
  - If the object does not exist, it returns `NULL`.
  - The optional `'object_type'` parameter filters results by object type (e.g., `'U'` for user tables).
- **Example Usage:**
  ```sql
  SELECT OBJECT_ID('dbo.Employees') AS ObjectID;
  ```
  **Output Example:**  
  ```
  ObjectID
  --------
  123456789
  ```
- **Use Case:** Helps in checking object existence before performing operations.

#### **Checking if an Object Exists Before Dropping It**
```sql
IF OBJECT_ID('dbo.TempTable') IS NOT NULL
    DROP TABLE dbo.TempTable;
```

---

## **2. OBJECT_NAME()**
- **Purpose:** Retrieves the name of an object using its ID.
- **Syntax:**
  ```sql
  OBJECT_NAME(object_id [, database_id])
  ```
- **Behavior:**
  - Returns the **name** of the object corresponding to the given ID.
  - If the object does not exist, it returns `NULL`.
- **Example Usage:**
  ```sql
  SELECT OBJECT_NAME(OBJECT_ID('dbo.Employees')) AS ObjectName;
  ```
  **Output Example:**  
  ```
  ObjectName
  ----------
  Employees
  ```
- **Use Case:** Useful for debugging and retrieving object names dynamically.

#### **Finding Object Names for All Tables**
```sql
SELECT name, OBJECT_NAME(object_id) AS TableName
FROM sys.objects
WHERE type = 'U';
```

---

## **3. OBJECT_DEFINITION()**
- **Purpose:** Returns the definition (DDL) of a stored procedure, function, or view.
- **Syntax:**
  ```sql
  OBJECT_DEFINITION(object_id)
  ```
- **Behavior:**
  - Returns the **SQL definition** of the object.
  - Works for stored procedures, functions, views, and triggers.
- **Example Usage:**
  ```sql
  SELECT OBJECT_DEFINITION(OBJECT_ID('dbo.GetEmployeeDetails')) AS ProcedureDefinition;
  ```
  **Output Example:**  
  ```
  ProcedureDefinition
  --------------------
  CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.GetEmployeeDetails AS ...
  ```
- **Use Case:** Helps in retrieving stored procedure or function definitions for debugging.

#### **Listing Definitions of All Stored Procedures**
```sql
SELECT name, OBJECT_DEFINITION(object_id) AS Definition
FROM sys.objects
WHERE type = 'P';
```

---

## **4. OBJECT_SCHEMA_NAME()**
- **Purpose:** Retrieves the schema name of an object.
- **Syntax:**
  ```sql
  OBJECT_SCHEMA_NAME(object_id [, database_id])
  ```
- **Behavior:**
  - Returns the **schema name** of the object.
  - If the object does not exist, it returns `NULL`.
- **Example Usage:**
  ```sql
  SELECT OBJECT_SCHEMA_NAME(OBJECT_ID('dbo.Employees')) AS SchemaName;
  ```
  **Output Example:**  
  ```
  SchemaName
  ----------
  dbo
  ```
- **Use Case:** Useful for retrieving schema information dynamically.

#### **Finding Schema Names for All Tables**
```sql
SELECT name, OBJECT_SCHEMA_NAME(object_id) AS SchemaName
FROM sys.objects
WHERE type = 'U';
```

### **Key Takeaways**
- `OBJECT_ID()` helps check object existence.
- `OBJECT_NAME()` retrieves object names dynamically.
- `OBJECT_DEFINITION()` extracts stored procedure or function definitions.
- `OBJECT_SCHEMA_NAME()` helps identify schema ownership.
