Certainly! Here's a point-by-point summary of the specified aggregate functions in SQL Server, based on the Microsoft documentation:

---

### 1. **STDEVP**

* **Purpose**: Calculates the statistical standard deviation for the entire population of a numeric expression.

* **Behavior**:

  * Ignores `NULL` values.
  * Returns `NULL` if there are fewer than two non-`NULL` values.
  * Assumes the data represents the entire population.

* **Return Type**: `float`

* **Syntax**:

  ```sql
  STDEVP (expression)
  ```



* **Example**:

  ```sql
  SELECT STDEVP(Salary) AS PopulationStdDev
  FROM Employees;
  ```



This query calculates the standard deviation of salaries, assuming the data represents the entire population.

---

### 2. **STRING\_AGG**

* **Purpose**: Concatenates values from multiple rows into a single string, separated by a specified delimiter.

* **Behavior**:

  * Ignores `NULL` values.
  * The order of concatenated values can be specified using `WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY ...)`.

* **Return Type**: `nvarchar` or `varchar` (depending on input)

* **Syntax**:

  ```sql
  STRING_AGG (expression, separator)
    [ WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY order_expression) ]
  ```



* **Example**:

  ```sql
  SELECT Department, STRING_AGG(EmployeeName, ', ') AS Employees
  FROM Employees
  GROUP BY Department;
  ```



This query lists employees in each department, concatenated into a single string separated by commas.

---

### 3. **SUM**

* **Purpose**: Calculates the total sum of a numeric expression.

* **Behavior**:

  * Ignores `NULL` values.
  * Returns `NULL` if there are no non-`NULL` values.

* **Return Type**: Same as the data type of the input expression.

* **Syntax**:

  ```sql
  SUM ( [ ALL | DISTINCT ] expression )
  ```



* **Example**:

  ```sql
  SELECT Department, SUM(Salary) AS TotalSalary
  FROM Employees
  GROUP BY Department;
  ```



This query calculates the total salary for each department.

---

### 4. **VAR**

* **Purpose**: Calculates the statistical variance for a sample of a numeric expression.

* **Behavior**:

  * Ignores `NULL` values.
  * Returns `NULL` if there are fewer than two non-`NULL` values.
  * Assumes the data is a sample of the entire population.

* **Return Type**: `float`

* **Syntax**:

  ```sql
  VAR (expression)
  ```



* **Example**:

  ```sql
  SELECT VAR(Salary) AS SampleVariance
  FROM Employees;
  ```



This query calculates the variance of salaries, assuming the data is a sample.

---

### 5. **VARP**

* **Purpose**: Calculates the statistical variance for the entire population of a numeric expression.

* **Behavior**:

  * Ignores `NULL` values.
  * Returns `NULL` if there are fewer than two non-`NULL` values.
  * Assumes the data represents the entire population.

* **Return Type**: `float`

* **Syntax**:

  ```sql
  VARP (expression)
  ```



* **Example**:

  ```sql
  SELECT VARP(Salary) AS PopulationVariance
  FROM Employees;
  ```



This query calculates the variance of salaries, assuming the data represents the entire population.
