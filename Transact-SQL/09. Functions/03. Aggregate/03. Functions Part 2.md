Certainly! Here's a point-by-point summary of the specified aggregate functions in SQL Server, based on the Microsoft documentation:

---

### 1. **GROUPING**

* **Purpose**: Indicates whether a specified column in a `GROUP BY` list is aggregated or not.([Microsoft Learn][1])

* **Return Value**: Returns `1` if the column is aggregated (i.e., not included in the `GROUP BY` clause), and `0` if it is not aggregated.

* **Usage**: Commonly used with `ROLLUP` or `CUBE` to distinguish super-aggregate rows from regular grouped rows.([Stack Overflow][2])

* **Syntax**:

```sql
  GROUPING (column_name)
```



* **Example**:

```sql
  SELECT Department, COUNT(*) AS EmployeeCount, GROUPING(Department) AS IsAggregated
  FROM Employees
  GROUP BY ROLLUP(Department);
```



In this example, the `GROUPING` function helps identify the row that contains the total count across all departments.

---

### 2. **GROUPING\_ID**

* **Purpose**: Returns a single integer that indicates the level of aggregation for a row, based on the columns specified in a `GROUP BY` clause with `ROLLUP`, `CUBE`, or `GROUPING SETS`.([Stack Overflow][2])

* **Return Value**: An integer representing a bitmap of the columns specified. Each bit corresponds to a column: `1` if the column is aggregated, `0` if not.

* **Usage**: Useful for identifying the specific grouping level of a row in complex aggregations.

* **Syntax**:

```sql
  GROUPING_ID (column1, column2, ..., columnN)
```



* **Example**:

```sql
  SELECT Department, Role, COUNT(*) AS EmployeeCount, GROUPING_ID(Department, Role) AS GroupingLevel
  FROM Employees
  GROUP BY ROLLUP(Department, Role);
```



In this example, `GROUPING_ID` helps differentiate between various levels of aggregation, such as totals by department, role, or overall total.

---

### 3. **MAX**

* **Purpose**: Returns the maximum value in a set of values.

* **Behavior**:

  * Ignores `NULL` values.
  * Returns `NULL` if there are no non-`NULL` values.
  * For character columns, it returns the highest value in the collating sequence.([Microsoft Learn][3])

* **Syntax**:

```sql
  MAX (expression)
```



* **Example**:

```sql
  SELECT MAX(Salary) AS HighestSalary
  FROM Employees;
```



This query returns the highest salary from the Employees table.([Stack Overflow][4])

---

### 4. **MIN**

* **Purpose**: Returns the minimum value in a set of values.([SQL Shack][5])

* **Behavior**:

  * Ignores `NULL` values.
  * Returns `NULL` if there are no non-`NULL` values.
  * For character columns, it returns the lowest value in the collating sequence.

* **Syntax**:

```sql
  MIN (expression)
```



* **Example**:

```sql
  SELECT MIN(HireDate) AS EarliestHireDate
  FROM Employees;
```



This query returns the earliest hire date from the Employees table.

---

### 5. **STDEV**

* **Purpose**: Calculates the statistical standard deviation of all values in the specified expression.([SQL Shack][5])

* **Behavior**:

  * Ignores `NULL` values.
  * Returns `NULL` if there are fewer than two non-`NULL` values.
  * Can be used with numeric columns only.([SQL Shack][5])

* **Return Type**: `float`

* **Syntax**:

```sql
  STDEV (expression)
```



* **Example**:

```sql
  SELECT STDEV(Salary) AS SalaryStdDev
  FROM Employees;
```



This query calculates the standard deviation of salaries in the Employees table.([SQL Shack][6])
