Here is a **point-by-point summary** of the Microsoft Docs article on **Aggregate Functions (Transact-SQL)** for SQL Server:

---

### ðŸ”¹ 1. **Definition and Purpose**

* Aggregate functions perform a calculation on a set of values and return a single summarizing value.
* They are commonly used with the `GROUP BY` clause in `SELECT` statements to group rows and calculate aggregate values for each group. ([Microsoft Learn][1], [W3Schools][2])

---

### ðŸ”¹ 2. **Common Aggregate Functions**

* **`AVG()`**: Calculates the average of a set of values.
* **`COUNT()`**: Returns the number of items in a group.
* **`MAX()`**: Finds the maximum value in a set.
* **`MIN()`**: Finds the minimum value in a set.
* **`SUM()`**: Calculates the total sum of a numeric column.
* **`STRING_AGG()`**: Concatenates values from multiple rows into a single string, separated by a specified delimiter. ([W3Schools][2], [Microsoft Learn][3])

---

### ðŸ”¹ 3. **Behavior with NULL Values**

* Except for `COUNT(*)`, aggregate functions ignore `NULL` values.
* For example, `AVG()` calculates the average of non-`NULL` values only. ([Microsoft Learn][4])

---

### ðŸ”¹ 4. **Determinism**

* Aggregate functions are deterministic, meaning they return the same result each time they are called with the same input values.
* This determinism ensures consistent results across queries.&#x20;

---

### ðŸ”¹ 5. **Usage with the OVER Clause**

* Aggregate functions can be used with the `OVER` clause to perform calculations across a set of rows related to the current row.
* This allows for advanced analytical queries, such as calculating running totals or moving averages.
* However, the `OVER` clause cannot be used with `STRING_AGG`, `GROUPING`, or `GROUPING_ID` functions. ([Microsoft Learn][4])

---

### ðŸ”¹ 6. **Usage in SELECT and HAVING Clauses**

* Aggregate functions are allowed in the `SELECT` list and the `HAVING` clause of a `SELECT` statement.
* The `HAVING` clause is used to filter groups based on aggregate values. ([Microsoft Learn][1])

---

### ðŸ”¹ 7. **Examples**

* **Calculating Average Salary**:

```sql
  SELECT AVG(Salary) AS AverageSalary FROM Employees;
```

* **Counting Employees**:

```sql
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS TotalEmployees FROM Employees;
```

* **Summing Sales by Region**:

```sql
  SELECT Region, SUM(Sales) AS TotalSales
  FROM SalesData
  GROUP BY Region;
```
