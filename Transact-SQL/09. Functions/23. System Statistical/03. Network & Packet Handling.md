Hereâ€™s a **deep dive** into **Network & Packet Handling Functions** in SQL Server, along with detailed explanations and examples.

---

## **1. @@PACK_SENT**
- **Purpose:** Returns the total number of network packets sent by SQL Server since startup.
- **Syntax:**
  ```sql
  SELECT @@PACK_SENT AS TotalPacketsSent;
  ```
- **Behavior:**
  - Increases as SQL Server sends data over the network.
  - Helps in **monitoring network activity**.
- **Example Usage:**
  ```sql
  SELECT @@PACK_SENT AS PacketsSentSinceStartup;
  ```
  **Output Example:**  
  ```
  PacketsSentSinceStartup
  -----------------------
  105678
  ```
- **Use Case:** Useful for **tracking network traffic** and **identifying high-load scenarios**.

---

## **2. @@PACKET_ERRORS**
- **Purpose:** Returns the total number of network packet errors encountered since SQL Server started.
- **Syntax:**
  ```sql
  SELECT @@PACKET_ERRORS AS TotalPacketErrors;
  ```
- **Behavior:**
  - Helps in **diagnosing network issues**.
  - If the value is high, it may indicate **network congestion or hardware problems**.
- **Example Usage:**
  ```sql
  SELECT @@PACKET_ERRORS AS PacketErrorCount;
  ```
  **Output Example:**  
  ```
  PacketErrorCount
  ----------------
  0
  ```
- **Use Case:** Useful for **troubleshooting network reliability** - SQL Server | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/functions/packet-errors-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver16).

## **3. @@TOTAL_READ & @@TOTAL_WRITE**
- **Purpose:** Returns the total number of disk reads and writes performed by SQL Server since startup.
- **Syntax:**
  ```sql
  SELECT @@TOTAL_READ AS TotalDiskReads, @@TOTAL_WRITE AS TotalDiskWrites;
  ```
- **Behavior:**
  - Helps in **monitoring disk I/O performance**.
  - High values may indicate **heavy database activity**.
- **Example Usage:**
  ```sql
  SELECT @@TOTAL_READ AS DiskReads, @@TOTAL_WRITE AS DiskWrites;
  ```
  **Output Example:**  
  ```
  DiskReads | DiskWrites
  ----------------------
  567890    | 345678
  ```
- **Use Case:** Useful for **identifying disk bottlenecks**.

### **Key Takeaways**
- `@@PACK_SENT` tracks **network traffic**.
- `@@PACKET_ERRORS` helps **diagnose network issues**.
- `@@TOTAL_READ` and `@@TOTAL_WRITE` monitor **disk I/O performance**.
