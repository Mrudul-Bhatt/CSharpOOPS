Hereâ€™s a **deep dive** into **CPU & I/O Performance Functions** in SQL Server, along with detailed explanations and examples.

---

## **1. @@CPU_BUSY**
- **Purpose:** Returns the total time (in milliseconds) that the CPU has been busy processing SQL Server tasks since the server started.
- **Syntax:**
  ```sql
  SELECT @@CPU_BUSY AS CpuBusyTime;
  ```
- **Behavior:**
  - Measures **CPU usage** for SQL Server processes.
  - Helps in **performance monitoring**.
- **Example Usage:**
  ```sql
  SELECT @@CPU_BUSY / @@TIMETICKS AS CpuBusySeconds;
  ```
  **Output Example:**  
  ```
  CpuBusySeconds
  --------------
  12567
  ```
- **Use Case:** Helps in **identifying CPU bottlenecks**.

## **2. @@IO_BUSY**
- **Purpose:** Returns the total time (in milliseconds) that SQL Server has spent on I/O operations since startup.
- **Syntax:**
  ```sql
  SELECT @@IO_BUSY AS IoBusyTime;
  ```
- **Behavior:**
  - Measures **disk I/O activity**.
  - Helps in **troubleshooting slow queries**.
- **Example Usage:**
  ```sql
  SELECT @@IO_BUSY / @@TIMETICKS AS IoBusySeconds;
  ```
  **Output Example:**  
  ```
  IoBusySeconds
  --------------
  9876
  ```
- **Use Case:** Useful for **identifying disk bottlenecks**.

## **3. @@IDLE**
- **Purpose:** Returns the total time (in milliseconds) that SQL Server has been idle since startup.
- **Syntax:**
  ```sql
  SELECT @@IDLE AS IdleTime;
  ```
- **Behavior:**
  - Measures **server inactivity**.
  - Helps in **resource utilization analysis**.
- **Example Usage:**
  ```sql
  SELECT @@IDLE / @@TIMETICKS AS IdleSeconds;
  ```
  **Output Example:**  
  ```
  IdleSeconds
  --------------
  45678
  ```
- **Use Case:** Helps in **determining server efficiency**.

### **Key Takeaways**
- `@@CPU_BUSY` tracks **CPU usage**.
- `@@IO_BUSY` monitors **disk I/O activity**.
- `@@IDLE` helps analyze **server efficiency**.
