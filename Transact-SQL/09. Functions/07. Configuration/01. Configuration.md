Certainly! Here's a point-by-point summary of the "Configuration Functions (Transact-SQL)" in SQL Server, based on the Microsoft documentation:

---

## Overview

Configuration functions in Transact-SQL are scalar functions that return information about the current configuration settings of the SQL Server instance. These functions are useful for retrieving system-level settings and can aid in performance tuning, troubleshooting, and understanding the environment in which SQL Server is running.

## Key Configuration Functions

1. **@@MAX\_CONNECTIONS**

   * **Purpose**: Returns the maximum number of simultaneous user connections allowed on the SQL Server instance.
   * **Usage**:

     ```sql
     SELECT @@MAX_CONNECTIONS AS 'Max Connections';
     ```

2. **@@MAX\_PRECISION**

   * **Purpose**: Returns the precision level used by decimal and numeric data types.
   * **Usage**:

     ```sql
     SELECT @@MAX_PRECISION AS 'Max Precision';
     ```

3. **@@NESTLEVEL**

   * **Purpose**: Returns the nesting level of the current stored procedure execution.
   * **Usage**:

     ```sql
     SELECT @@NESTLEVEL AS 'Nesting Level';
     ```

4. **@@OPTIONS**

   * **Purpose**: Returns information about the current SET options enabled for the session.
   * **Usage**:

     ```sql
     SELECT @@OPTIONS AS 'Set Options';
     ```

5. **@@REMSERVER**

   * **Purpose**: Returns the name of the remote SQL Server connected to (if any).
   * **Usage**:

     ```sql
     SELECT @@REMSERVER AS 'Remote Server';
     ```

6. **@@SERVERNAME**

   * **Purpose**: Returns the name of the local server running SQL Server.
   * **Usage**:

     ```sql
     SELECT @@SERVERNAME AS 'Server Name';
     ```

7. **@@SERVICENAME**

   * **Purpose**: Returns the name of the registry key under which SQL Server is running.
   * **Usage**:

     ```sql
     SELECT @@SERVICENAME AS 'Service Name';
     ```

8. **@@SPID**

   * **Purpose**: Returns the session ID of the current user process.
   * **Usage**:

     ```sql
     SELECT @@SPID AS 'Session ID';
     ```

9. **@@VERSION**

   * **Purpose**: Returns the SQL Server version, processor architecture, build date, and operating system version.
   * **Usage**:

     ```sql
     SELECT @@VERSION AS 'SQL Server Version';
     ```

## Usage Notes

* These functions are read-only and cannot be used to change configuration settings.
* They are useful for diagnostics, logging, and understanding the environment in which SQL Server is operating.
* Some functions, like `@@OPTIONS`, return bitmask values that may require additional interpretation to understand which options are enabled.
