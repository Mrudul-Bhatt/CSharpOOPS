### **2. DATE_BUCKET()**
- **Purpose:** Groups dates into fixed-size buckets.
- **Syntax:**
  ```sql
  DATE_BUCKET(interval, number, date)
  ```
- **Example Usage:**
  ```sql
  SELECT DATE_BUCKET(MONTH, 3, '2025-05-14') AS BucketedDate;
  ```
  **Output:** `2025-03-01`

### **3. DATETRUNC()**
- **Purpose:** Truncates a date to a specified part (e.g., month, year).
- **Syntax:**
  ```sql

  ```sql
  SELECT DATETRUNC(MONTH, '2025-05-14') AS TruncatedDate;
  ```
  **Output:** `2025-05-01`

- **Use Case:** Helps in grouping data by month or year in reports.
