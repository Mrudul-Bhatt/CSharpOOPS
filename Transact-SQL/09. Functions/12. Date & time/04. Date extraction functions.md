Hereâ€™s a **deep dive** into **Date Extraction Functions** in SQL Server, along with detailed explanations and examples.

---

## **1. YEAR(), MONTH(), DAY()**
- **Purpose:** Extracts individual components (year, month, day) from a date.
- **Syntax:**
  ```sql
  SELECT YEAR(date), MONTH(date), DAY(date);
  ```
- **Example Usage:**
  ```sql
  SELECT YEAR('2025-05-14') AS YearValue,
         MONTH('2025-05-14') AS MonthValue,
         DAY('2025-05-14') AS DayValue;
  ```
  **Output:**  
  ```
  YearValue | MonthValue | DayValue
  ---------------------------------
  2025      | 5          | 14
  ```

- **Use Case:** Useful for filtering records based on specific date components.

---

## **2. DATEPART()**
- **Purpose:** Extracts a specific part of a date (e.g., hour, minute, second).
- **Syntax:**
  ```sql
  DATEPART(part, date)
  ```
- **Common Parts:**
  - `YEAR`, `MONTH`, `DAY`
  - `HOUR`, `MINUTE`, `SECOND`
  - `WEEKDAY` (returns day of the week as a number)
- **Example Usage:**
  ```sql
  SELECT DATEPART(HOUR, '2025-05-14 15:30:45') AS HourValue;
  ```
  **Output:** `15`

- **Use Case:** Helps in grouping data by time intervals.

---

## **3. DATENAME()**
- **Purpose:** Returns the name of a specific date part (e.g., month name, weekday name).
- **Syntax:**
  ```sql
  DATENAME(part, date)
  ```
- **Common Parts:**
  - `MONTH` (returns month name)
  - `WEEKDAY` (returns weekday name)
- **Example Usage:**
  ```sql
  SELECT DATENAME(MONTH, '2025-05-14') AS MonthName,
         DATENAME(WEEKDAY, '2025-05-14') AS WeekdayName;
  ```
  **Output:**  
  ```
  MonthName | WeekdayName
  -----------------------
  May       | Wednesday
  ```

- **Use Case:** Useful for formatting reports and user-friendly date displays.

---

## **4. DATEFROMPARTS()**
- **Purpose:** Constructs a `date` value from individual components.
- **Syntax:**
  ```sql
  DATEFROMPARTS(year, month, day)
  ```
- **Example Usage:**
  ```sql
  SELECT DATEFROMPARTS(2025, 5, 14) AS ConstructedDate;
  ```
  **Output:** `2025-05-14`

- **Use Case:** Helps in dynamically generating dates.

---

### **Key Takeaways**
- `YEAR()`, `MONTH()`, `DAY()` extract basic date components.
- `DATEPART()` retrieves numeric values for various date parts.
- `DATENAME()` provides human-readable names for months and weekdays.
- `DATEFROMPARTS()` constructs a date from individual values.
