Hereâ€™s a **deep dive** into **Date Manipulation Functions** in SQL Server, along with detailed explanations and examples.

---

## **1. DATEADD()**
- **Purpose:** Adds a specified interval (e.g., days, months, years) to a given date.
- **Syntax:**
  ```sql
  DATEADD(interval, number, date)
  ```
- **Common Intervals:**
  - `YEAR`, `MONTH`, `DAY`
  - `HOUR`, `MINUTE`, `SECOND`
- **Example Usage:**
  ```sql
  SELECT DATEADD(DAY, 7, '2025-05-14') AS OneWeekLater;
  ```
  **Output:** `2025-05-21`

- **Use Case:** Useful for scheduling tasks, calculating expiration dates, and adjusting timestamps.

---

## **2. DATEDIFF()**
- **Purpose:** Calculates the difference between two dates in a specified unit.
- **Syntax:**
  ```sql
  DATEDIFF(interval, start_date, end_date)
  ```
- **Common Intervals:**
  - `YEAR`, `MONTH`, `DAY`
  - `HOUR`, `MINUTE`, `SECOND`
- **Example Usage:**
  ```sql
  SELECT DATEDIFF(DAY, '2025-05-01', '2025-05-14') AS DaysDifference;
  ```
  **Output:** `13`

- **Use Case:** Helps determine age, duration, or time gaps between events.

---

## **3. DATEDIFF_BIG()**
- **Purpose:** Similar to `DATEDIFF()`, but supports larger values.
- **Syntax:**
  ```sql
  DATEDIFF_BIG(interval, start_date, end_date)
  ```
- **Example Usage:**
  ```sql
  SELECT DATEDIFF_BIG(SECOND, '2000-01-01', '2025-05-14') AS SecondsDifference;
  ```
  **Output:** Large integer value representing seconds.

- **Use Case:** Useful for long-duration calculations, such as tracking timestamps over decades.

---

## **4. EOMONTH()**
- **Purpose:** Returns the last day of the month for a given date.
- **Syntax:**
  ```sql
  EOMONTH(date, offset)
  ```
- **Example Usage:**
  ```sql
  SELECT EOMONTH('2025-05-14') AS LastDayOfMonth;
  ```
  **Output:** `2025-05-31`

- **Use Case:** Helps in financial reporting, billing cycles, and month-end calculations.

---

## **5. DATETRUNC()**
- **Purpose:** Truncates a date to a specified part (e.g., month, year).
- **Syntax:**
  ```sql
  DATETRUNC(part, date)
  ```
- **Example Usage:**
  ```sql
  SELECT DATETRUNC(MONTH, '2025-05-14') AS TruncatedDate;
  ```
  **Output:** `2025-05-01`

- **Use Case:** Useful for grouping data by month or year in reports.

---

### **Key Takeaways**
- `DATEADD()` is used for adding time intervals.
- `DATEDIFF()` and `DATEDIFF_BIG()` calculate differences between dates.
- `EOMONTH()` helps determine the last day of a month.
- `DATETRUNC()` is useful for rounding dates to specific parts.
