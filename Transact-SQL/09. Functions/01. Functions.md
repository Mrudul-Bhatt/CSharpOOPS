Here is a **point-by-point summary** of the Microsoft Docs article titled **"What are the SQL database functions?"** for SQL Server:

---

### ðŸ”¹ 1. **Overview of SQL Database Functions**

* SQL Server provides a variety of built-in functions that can be used in queries to perform operations on data.
* These functions can be categorized into several types, each serving different purposes.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 2. **Categories of SQL Functions**

#### a. **Aggregate Functions**

* Perform calculations on a set of values and return a single value.
* Common aggregate functions include `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MIN()`, and `MAX()`.
* Often used with the `GROUP BY` clause to group rows that have the same values into summary rows.([Microsoft Learn][1])

#### b. **Analytic Functions**

* Compute an aggregate value based on a group of rows.
* Unlike aggregate functions, analytic functions can return multiple rows for each group.
* Useful for calculations like moving averages, running totals, and ranking.([Microsoft Learn][1])

#### c. **Bit Manipulation Functions**

* Allow you to process and store data more efficiently than with individual bits.
* Introduced in SQL Server 2022 (16.x).
* Examples include `BITAND()`, `BITOR()`, and `BITXOR()`.([Microsoft Learn][1])

#### d. **Ranking Functions**

* Return a ranking value for each row in a partition.
* Some rows might receive the same value as other rows.
* Examples include `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, and `DENSE_RANK()`.
* These functions are nondeterministic.([Microsoft Learn][1], [Microsoft Learn][2])

#### e. **Rowset Functions**

* Return an object that can be used like table references in a SQL statement.
* Examples include `OPENQUERY()`, `OPENROWSET()`, and `OPENDATASOURCE()`.([Microsoft Learn][1])

#### f. **Scalar Functions**

* Operate on a single value and return a single value.
* Scalar functions can be used wherever an expression is valid.
* Examples include `GETDATE()`, `LEN()`, `UPPER()`, and `CONVERT()`.([Microsoft Learn][1])

---

### ðŸ”¹ 3. **User-Defined Functions (UDFs)**

* SQL Server allows you to create your own functions using the `CREATE FUNCTION` statement.
* UDFs can accept parameters, perform an action, and return a result.
* The return value can be a scalar value or a table.
* UDFs can be used in SQL statements just like built-in functions.([en.wikipedia.org][3], [Microsoft Learn][4])

---

### ðŸ”¹ 4. **Deterministic vs. Nondeterministic Functions**

* **Deterministic Functions**: Always return the same result any time they're called with a specific set of input values.
* **Nondeterministic Functions**: May return different results each time they're called, even with the same input values.
* Examples of deterministic functions include `UPPER()` and `LEN()`.
* Examples of nondeterministic functions include `GETDATE()` and `NEWID()`.([Microsoft Learn][2])

---

### ðŸ”¹ 5. **Considerations When Using Functions**

* Some functions, especially nondeterministic ones, can affect the performance of queries.
* Using functions in `WHERE` clauses can prevent the use of indexes, leading to full table scans.
* It's important to understand the behavior and performance implications of the functions you use.
