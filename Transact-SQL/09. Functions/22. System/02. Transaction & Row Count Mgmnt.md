Hereâ€™s a **deep dive** into **Transaction & Row Count Management Functions** in SQL Server, along with detailed explanations and examples.

---

## **1. @@TRANCOUNT**
- **Purpose:** Returns the number of active transactions in the current session.
- **Syntax:**
  ```sql
  SELECT @@TRANCOUNT AS ActiveTransactions;
  ```
- **Behavior:**
  - If no transaction is active, it returns `0`.
  - Each `BEGIN TRANSACTION` increases the count by `1`.
  - Each `COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK` decreases the count.
- **Example Usage:**
  ```sql
  BEGIN TRANSACTION;
  SELECT @@TRANCOUNT AS TransactionCount; -- Returns 1
  
  BEGIN TRANSACTION;
  SELECT @@TRANCOUNT AS TransactionCount; -- Returns 2
  
  COMMIT;
  SELECT @@TRANCOUNT AS TransactionCount; -- Returns 1
  
  ROLLBACK;
  SELECT @@TRANCOUNT AS TransactionCount; -- Returns 0
  ```
- **Use Case:** Helps in **tracking nested transactions** and ensuring proper rollback.

## **2. @@ROWCOUNT**
- **Purpose:** Returns the number of rows affected by the last statement.
- **Syntax:**
  ```sql
  SELECT @@ROWCOUNT AS RowsAffected;
  ```
- **Behavior:**
  - Works with `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` statements.
  - Must be used **immediately** after the statement to capture the correct value.
- **Example Usage:**
  ```sql
  UPDATE Employees SET Salary = Salary * 1.1 WHERE Department = 'HR';
  SELECT @@ROWCOUNT AS UpdatedRows;
  ```
  **Output Example:**  
  ```
  UpdatedRows
  ------------
  5
  ```
- **Use Case:** Useful for **error handling** and **business logic validation**.

---

## **3. ROWCOUNT_BIG()**
- **Purpose:** Similar to `@@ROWCOUNT`, but returns a `BIGINT` value for large datasets.
- **Syntax:**
  ```sql
  SELECT ROWCOUNT_BIG() AS RowsAffected;
  ```
- **Example Usage:**
  ```sql
  DELETE FROM LargeTable WHERE CreatedDate < '2020-01-01';
  SELECT ROWCOUNT_BIG() AS DeletedRows;
  ```
- **Use Case:** Helps when dealing with **large-scale data operations**.

---

## **4. XACT_STATE()**
- **Purpose:** Returns the state of the current transaction.
- **Syntax:**
  ```sql
  SELECT XACT_STATE() AS TransactionState;
  ```
- **Behavior:**
  - Returns `1` if the transaction is **active and committable**.
  - Returns `0` if **no transaction is active**.
  - Returns `-1` if the transaction is **uncommittable** (must be rolled back).
- **Example Usage:**
  ```sql
  BEGIN TRANSACTION;
  
  -- Intentional error
  UPDATE Employees SET Salary = Salary / 0;
  
  SELECT XACT_STATE() AS TransactionState;
  
  IF XACT_STATE() = -1
      ROLLBACK;
  ELSE
      COMMIT;
  ```
- **Use Case:** Helps in **handling transaction failures gracefully**.

### **Key Takeaways**
- `@@TRANCOUNT` tracks **active transactions**.
- `@@ROWCOUNT` and `ROWCOUNT_BIG()` help **monitor row changes**.
- `XACT_STATE()` ensures **safe transaction handling**.
