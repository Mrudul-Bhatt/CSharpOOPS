Certainly! Here's a point-by-point summary of the article **"Analytic Functions (Transact-SQL)"** from Microsoft Docs for SQL Server:

### üîç What Are Analytic Functions?

* **Definition**: Analytic functions compute aggregate values based on a group of rows.([Microsoft Learn][1])

* **Difference from Aggregate Functions**: Unlike aggregate functions, which return a single result for a group, analytic functions can return multiple rows for each group.([Microsoft Learn][2])

* **Use Cases**: Ideal for calculations such as moving averages, running totals, percentages, or top-N results within a group.([Microsoft Learn][3])

---

### üß© Key Characteristics

* **OVER Clause Requirement**: Analytic functions require the use of the `OVER` clause, which defines the partitioning and ordering of rows.([Microsoft Learn][1])

* **Non-Reducing Nature**: They do not reduce the number of rows returned by a query; instead, they add additional information to each row.

* **Partitioning and Ordering**: The `OVER` clause allows specifying `PARTITION BY` to divide the result set into partitions and `ORDER BY` to define the logical order within each partition.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Common Analytic Functions

* **Ranking Functions**: Assign a rank to each row within a partition. Examples include `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`, and `NTILE()`.

* **Offset Functions**: Access data from a row at a specified physical offset. Examples include `LAG()` and `LEAD()`.([Microsoft Learn][4])

* **Aggregate Functions with OVER**: Traditional aggregate functions like `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MIN()`, `MAX()`, and `COUNT()` can be used as analytic functions when combined with the `OVER` clause.

### üìå Example Usage

To calculate a running total of sales for each department:([Microsoft Learn][3])

```sql
SELECT Department, Sales, 
       SUM(Sales) OVER (PARTITION BY Department ORDER BY SalesDate) AS RunningTotal
FROM SalesData;
```



In this example, `SUM(Sales) OVER (PARTITION BY Department ORDER BY SalesDate)` computes a running total of sales within each department, ordered by the sales date.
