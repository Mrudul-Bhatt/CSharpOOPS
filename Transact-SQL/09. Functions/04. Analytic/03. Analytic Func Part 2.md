Certainly! Here's a concise, point-by-point summary of the following SQL Server analytic functions, based on the Microsoft documentation:

---

## 1. **LEAD (Transact-SQL)**

* **Purpose**: Accesses data from a subsequent row in the same result set without the use of a self-join.([Microsoft Learn][1])

* **Syntax**:

```sql
  LEAD (scalar_expression [, offset [, default]]) OVER ( [PARTITION BY partition_expression] ORDER BY order_expression)
```



* **Parameters**:

  * `scalar_expression`: The column or expression to return.
  * `offset`: The number of rows forward from the current row (default is 1).
  * `default`: The value to return when the `offset` goes beyond the scope of the partition.

* **Behavior**:

  * Returns the value from the row at the specified `offset` after the current row within the partition.
  * If the `offset` goes beyond the scope of the partition, returns `NULL` or the specified `default`.([Microsoft Learn][1])

* **Example**:

```sql
  SELECT Name, Salary,
         LEAD(Salary, 1, 0) OVER (ORDER BY Salary) AS NextSalary
  FROM Employees;
```



This query returns each employee's salary along with the salary of the next employee in order.

---

## 2. **PERCENT\_RANK (Transact-SQL)**

* **Purpose**: Calculates the relative rank of a row within a group of rows.([Microsoft Learn][2])

* **Syntax**:

```sql
  PERCENT_RANK() OVER ( [PARTITION BY partition_expression] ORDER BY order_expression)
```



* **Behavior**:

  * Returns a float value from 0 to 1, exclusive.
  * The first row in each partition has a `PERCENT_RANK` of 0.
  * Rows with equal values receive the same rank.

* **Example**:

```sql
  SELECT Name, Department, Salary,
         PERCENT_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY Department ORDER BY Salary) AS PercentRank
  FROM Employees;
```



This query calculates the percent rank of each employee's salary within their department.([Microsoft Learn][3])

---

## 3. **PERCENTILE\_CONT (Transact-SQL)**

* **Purpose**: Computes a percentile value based on a continuous distribution of the column value.([Microsoft Learn][4])

* **Syntax**:

```sql
  PERCENTILE_CONT(numeric_literal)
      WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY order_expression)
      OVER ( [PARTITION BY partition_expression] )
```



* **Parameters**:

  * `numeric_literal`: The percentile to compute (e.g., 0.5 for median).([Database Administrators Stack Exchange][5])

* **Behavior**:

  * Interpolates the value at the specified percentile.
  * The result may not be equal to any specific value in the dataset.([Microsoft Learn][4])

* **Example**:

```sql
  SELECT Department,
         PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY Salary) OVER (PARTITION BY Department) AS MedianSalary
  FROM Employees;
```



This query calculates the median salary for each department.([Microsoft Learn][6])

---

## 4. **PERCENTILE\_DISC (Transact-SQL)**

* **Purpose**: Computes a percentile value based on a discrete distribution of the column value.([Microsoft Learn][4])

* **Syntax**:

```sql
  PERCENTILE_DISC(numeric_literal)
      WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY order_expression)
      OVER ( [PARTITION BY partition_expression] )
```



* **Parameters**:

  * `numeric_literal`: The percentile to compute (e.g., 0.5 for median).([Qlik Community][7])

* **Behavior**:

  * Returns the first value whose cumulative distribution is greater than or equal to the specified percentile.
  * The result is always a value from the dataset.([MSSQL Tips][8])

* **Example**:

```sql
  SELECT Department,
         PERCENTILE_DISC(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY Salary) OVER (PARTITION BY Department) AS MedianSalary
  FROM Employees;
```



This query calculates the median salary for each department, returning an actual salary value from the dataset.
