# **Explanation of "Cursors (Transact-SQL)" in Microsoft Docs**  

Cursors in SQL Server allow row-by-row processing of result sets, which is different from the default set-based operations in SQL. The **[Microsoft Docs article on Cursors (Transact-SQL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/language-elements/cursors-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver16)** explains their syntax, types, and usage. Below is a structured breakdown:

---

## **1. What is a Cursor?**  
- A database object used to **retrieve and manipulate rows one at a time**.  
- Used when **row-by-row operations** are necessary (e.g., complex calculations, row-dependent updates).  
- **Not recommended for large datasets** (slow compared to set-based operations).  

---

## **2. Cursor Lifecycle**  
### **(1) Declaration (`DECLARE CURSOR`)**  
Defines the cursor with a `SELECT` statement.  
```sql
DECLARE cursor_name CURSOR [LOCAL | GLOBAL]  
    [FORWARD_ONLY | SCROLL]  
    [STATIC | KEYSET | DYNAMIC | FAST_FORWARD]  
    [READ_ONLY | SCROLL_LOCKS | OPTIMISTIC]  
    FOR select_statement  
    [FOR UPDATE [OF column_list]];  
```

### **(2) Opening the Cursor (`OPEN`)**  
Executes the `SELECT` statement and populates the cursor.  
```sql
OPEN cursor_name;  
```

### **(3) Fetching Rows (`FETCH`)**  
Retrieves rows one by one.  
```sql
FETCH [NEXT | PRIOR | FIRST | LAST | ABSOLUTE n | RELATIVE n]  
FROM cursor_name INTO @variable1, @variable2, ...;  
```

### **(4) Closing the Cursor (`CLOSE`)**  
Releases the result set but keeps the cursor structure.  
```sql
CLOSE cursor_name;  
```

### **(5) Deallocating the Cursor (`DEALLOCATE`)**  
Removes the cursor from memory.  
```sql
DEALLOCATE cursor_name;  
```

## **3. Types of Cursors**  
| Type | Description | Use Case |  
|------|------------|----------|  
| **STATIC** | Creates a snapshot in `tempdb`; no live updates. | Safe for read-only operations. |  
| **DYNAMIC** | Reflects changes made by others while scrolling. | Real-time data tracking. |  
| **KEYSET** | Locks only key columns; detects deletions. | Balance between static & dynamic. |  
| **FAST_FORWARD** | Optimized, read-only, forward-only. | Best performance for read-only ops. |  

---

## **4. Cursor Options**  
| Option | Description |  
|--------|------------|  
| **LOCAL** | Cursor is available only in the current scope. |  
| **GLOBAL** | Cursor can be accessed by other batches/procedures. |  
| **FORWARD_ONLY** | Can only move forward (default for most cursors). |  
| **SCROLL** | Supports bidirectional movement (`FIRST`, `LAST`, `ABSOLUTE`). |  
| **READ_ONLY** | Prevents updates via the cursor. |  
| **SCROLL_LOCKS** | Locks rows to guarantee updatability. |  
| **OPTIMISTIC** | Allows updates but checks for conflicts before saving. |

## **5. Example: Basic Cursor Usage**  
```sql
-- Declare variables
DECLARE @EmployeeID INT, @EmployeeName VARCHAR(100);  

-- Declare cursor
DECLARE employee_cursor CURSOR FOR  
    SELECT EmployeeID, Name FROM Employees WHERE Department = 'Sales';  

-- Open cursor
OPEN employee_cursor;  

-- Fetch first row
FETCH NEXT FROM employee_cursor INTO @EmployeeID, @EmployeeName;  

-- Loop through rows
WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0  
BEGIN  
    PRINT 'Processing: ' + @EmployeeName;  
    -- (Perform row-specific logic here)  
    FETCH NEXT FROM employee_cursor INTO @EmployeeID, @EmployeeName;  
END  

-- Cleanup
CLOSE employee_cursor;  
DEALLOCATE employee_cursor;  
```

## **6. When to Use Cursors?**  
✅ **Appropriate Use Cases:**  
- Row-by-row validation or complex calculations.  
- Iterating through hierarchical data (e.g., trees/graphs).  
- Administrative tasks (e.g., dynamic SQL generation).  

❌ **Avoid When:**  
- Processing large datasets (slow performance).  
- Set-based operations can achieve the same result (prefer `JOIN`, `UPDATE`, `MERGE`).  

---

## **7. Performance Considerations**  
- **Cursors are slower** than set-based operations due to row-by-row processing.  
- **Use `FAST_FORWARD`** for read-only operations to optimize speed.  
- **Consider alternatives** like `WHILE` loops with temp tables for better performance.  

---

## **8. Conclusion**  
- Cursors provide **fine-grained row control** but should be used sparingly.  
- Prefer **set-based SQL** for most operations.  
- Choose the **right cursor type** (`STATIC`, `DYNAMIC`, `FAST_FORWARD`) based on needs.
