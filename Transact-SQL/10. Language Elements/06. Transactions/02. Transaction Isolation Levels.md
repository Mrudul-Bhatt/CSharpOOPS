# **Transaction Isolation Levels in SQL Server**

The **[Transaction Isolation Levels](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/language-elements/transaction-isolation-levels-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver16)** article explains how SQL Server controls the visibility of data modifications between concurrent transactions, balancing consistency and performance.

## **1. Isolation Level Fundamentals**

Isolation levels determine:
- How transactions interact with concurrent operations
- What data modifications are visible to other transactions
- The trade-off between consistency and concurrency

## **2. Supported Isolation Levels**

### **1. READ UNCOMMITTED**
- **Behavior**: Allows dirty reads (seeing uncommitted changes)
- **Concurrency**: Highest
- **Consistency**: Lowest
- **Use Case**: Approximate reporting where accuracy isn't critical

```sql
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED;
```

### **2. READ COMMITTED (Default)**
- **Behavior**: Prevents dirty reads (only sees committed data)
- **Concurrency**: High
- **Consistency**: Moderate
- **Variants**:
  - **READ COMMITTED SNAPSHOT** (RCSI): Uses row versioning
  - **Locking READ COMMITTED**: Uses shared locks

```sql
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;
```

### **3. REPEATABLE READ**
- **Behavior**: Prevents dirty reads and non-repeatable reads
- **Concurrency**: Moderate
- **Consistency**: High
- **Locking**: Holds shared locks until transaction ends

```sql
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ;
```

### **4. SERIALIZABLE**
- **Behavior**: Prevents dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantoms
- **Concurrency**: Lowest
- **Consistency**: Highest
- **Locking**: Range locks to prevent new rows matching criteria

```sql
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
```

### **5. SNAPSHOT**
- **Behavior**: Transaction sees data as it existed at start
- **Concurrency**: High
- **Consistency**: High
- **Requirement**: Must enable ALLOW_SNAPSHOT_ISOLATION

```sql
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SNAPSHOT;
```

## **3. Concurrency Phenomena Controlled**

| Phenomenon | Description | Prevented By |
|------------|-------------|--------------|
| **Dirty Read** | Reading uncommitted changes | READ COMMITTED+ |
| **Non-Repeatable Read** | Different values on re-read | REPEATABLE READ+ |
| **Phantom Read** | New rows appear in re-read | SERIALIZABLE |
| **Lost Update** | Overwriting another's change | All levels (implicitly) |

## **4. Implementation Details**

### **Locking vs. Versioning**
- **Locking** (READ COMMITTED, REPEATABLE READ, SERIALIZABLE):
  - Uses shared/exclusive locks
  - Blocks conflicting operations
- **Versioning** (SNAPSHOT, READ COMMITTED SNAPSHOT):
  - Uses tempdb version store
  - No blocking for readers

### **Configuration Requirements**
```sql
-- For SNAPSHOT isolation
ALTER DATABASE YourDB 
SET ALLOW_SNAPSHOT_ISOLATION ON;

-- For READ COMMITTED SNAPSHOT
ALTER DATABASE YourDB 
SET READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT ON;
```

## **5. Performance Considerations**

| Level | Reads Block Writes | Writes Block Reads | TempDB Usage |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| READ UNCOMMITTED | No | No | No |
| READ COMMITTED (Locking) | Yes | Yes | No |
| READ COMMITTED SNAPSHOT | No | Yes | Yes |
| REPEATABLE READ | Yes | Yes | No |
| SERIALIZABLE | Yes | Yes | No |
| SNAPSHOT | No | No | Yes |

## **6. Best Practices**
1. **Use READ COMMITTED SNAPSHOT** for most OLTP systems
2. **Reserve SERIALIZABLE** for critical financial operations
3. **Avoid READ UNCOMMITTED** for transactional data
4. **Monitor blocking** with:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM sys.dm_tran_locks;
   SELECT * FROM sys.dm_os_wait_stats;
   ```

## **7. Practical Examples**

### **Choosing an Isolation Level**
```sql
-- For reporting (allow dirty reads)
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED;
SELECT * FROM LargeTable;

-- For financial transaction
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
    -- Transfer funds between accounts
COMMIT TRANSACTION;
```

### **Identifying Isolation Level**
```sql
SELECT CASE transaction_isolation_level 
        WHEN 0 THEN 'Unspecified' 
        WHEN 1 THEN 'ReadUncommitted' 
        WHEN 2 THEN 'ReadCommitted' 
        WHEN 3 THEN 'Repeatable' 
        WHEN 4 THEN 'Serializable' 
        WHEN 5 THEN 'Snapshot' 
       END AS isolation_level
FROM sys.dm_exec_sessions
WHERE session_id = @@SPID;
```

Understanding isolation levels is crucial for designing concurrent systems that balance data integrity with performance requirements. The choice depends on your application's tolerance for concurrency anomalies versus the need for strict consistency.
