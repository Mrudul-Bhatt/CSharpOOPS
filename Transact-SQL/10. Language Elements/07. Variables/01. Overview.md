Certainly! The Microsoft Docs article **"Variables (Transact-SQL)"** provides a detailed overview of how to declare and use variables in **Transact-SQL (T-SQL)**, which is the extension of SQL used by **Microsoft SQL Server**.

Here's a comprehensive explanation of the article, broken down into sections with detailed **examples and notes**.

---

## 🔹 What Are Variables in Transact-SQL?

In T-SQL, **variables** are used to temporarily store values. You can use them to hold data like numbers, strings, dates, and more. These are **local** to the batch, stored procedure, or function in which they are declared.

---

## 🔹 Declaring Variables

Use the `DECLARE` statement:

```sql
DECLARE @MyInt INT;
DECLARE @MyString NVARCHAR(50);
DECLARE @MyDate DATE;
```

* `@` prefix is mandatory.
* Variables must have a valid SQL Server data type.

> Note: You can declare multiple variables in one `DECLARE` statement:

```sql
DECLARE @Id INT, @Name NVARCHAR(100), @BirthDate DATE;
```

---

## 🔹 Initializing Variables

### 🔸 Using `SET`

```sql
DECLARE @MyInt INT;
SET @MyInt = 10;
```

### 🔸 Using `SELECT`

```sql
DECLARE @MyName NVARCHAR(50);
SELECT @MyName = 'John Doe';
```

Both `SET` and `SELECT` can assign values, but **there are differences**:

* `SET` can only assign **one variable at a time**.
* `SELECT` can assign **multiple variables at once** from a query.

```sql
DECLARE @Id INT, @Name NVARCHAR(50);
SELECT @Id = 1, @Name = 'Alice';
```

When assigning from a query:

```sql
DECLARE @FirstName NVARCHAR(50);
SELECT @FirstName = FirstName FROM Students WHERE StudentID = 1001;
```

> ⚠️ If the query returns multiple rows:

* `SET` fails with an error.
* `SELECT` assigns the value from the **last row**.

---

## 🔹 Using Variables

Once declared and assigned, variables can be used in queries, control-of-flow statements, or other T-SQL code.

### Example – Using in an IF statement:

```sql
DECLARE @Age INT;
SET @Age = 25;

IF @Age >= 18
    PRINT 'Adult';
ELSE
    PRINT 'Minor';
```

---

## 🔹 Variables in Queries

You can use variables in `WHERE`, `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, etc.

```sql
DECLARE @StudentId INT = 1001;

SELECT * FROM Students
WHERE StudentID = @StudentId;
```

---

## 🔹 Scope of Variables

* Variables are only visible **within the batch, stored procedure, or function** in which they are declared.
* They are **not shared** between sessions or connections.

---

## 🔹 Table Variables

T-SQL also supports **table variables**.

```sql
DECLARE @MyTable TABLE (
    ID INT,
    Name NVARCHAR(100)
);

INSERT INTO @MyTable (ID, Name)
VALUES (1, 'Alice'), (2, 'Bob');

SELECT * FROM @MyTable;
```

Table variables are useful for storing temporary sets of rows in memory. They are **local to the batch or procedure**, similar to scalar variables.

---

## 🔹 Example – Complete Scenario

```sql
DECLARE @StudentId INT = 1001;
DECLARE @FirstName NVARCHAR(50);
DECLARE @Age INT;

SELECT @FirstName = FirstName, @Age = Age
FROM Students
WHERE StudentID = @StudentId;

IF @Age >= 18
    PRINT @FirstName + ' is an adult.';
ELSE
    PRINT @FirstName + ' is a minor.';
```

## 🔹 Important Notes

| Feature              | `SET`                    | `SELECT`                              |
| -------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Multiple Assignments | ❌ One at a time          | ✅ Multiple at once                    |
| Return from Query    | ❌ Fails if multiple rows | ✅ Takes value from the last row       |
| Use in Queries       | ❌                        | ✅ Supports assignment from subqueries |

---

## 🔹 Summary

* **Declare** variables using `DECLARE`.
* **Assign** using `SET` (for one variable) or `SELECT` (for multiple).
* Use variables to **store and manipulate data** within T-SQL scripts.
* **Scope is local**, and variables are reset each time a batch/procedure runs.
* **Table variables** allow temporary row storage like mini tables.
