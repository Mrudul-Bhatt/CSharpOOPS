# **Wildcard String Operators in Transact-SQL (SQL Server)**

These specialized operators are used with the `LIKE` clause for advanced pattern matching in strings.

## **1. `[ ]` (Character Set Wildcard)**
**Purpose**: Matches any single character within the specified set or range.

### **Key Features**
- Matches exactly one character from the enclosed set
- Supports ranges (e.g., `[a-f]`) and individual characters (e.g., `[aeiou]`)
- Case sensitivity depends on collation

### **Examples**
```sql
-- Find names starting with A, B, or C
SELECT * FROM Customers 
WHERE LastName LIKE '[A-C]%';

-- Find products with codes containing 1, 3, or 5 in second position
SELECT * FROM Products 
WHERE ProductCode LIKE '_[135]%';

-- Match specific characters
SELECT * FROM Employees 
WHERE FirstName LIKE '[JM]ohn';  -- John or Mohm
```

## **2. `[^ ]` (Negative Character Set Wildcard)**
**Purpose**: Matches any single character NOT in the specified set or range.

### **Key Features**
- Opposite of `[ ]` operator
- Excludes characters from the match
- Useful for filtering out specific patterns

### **Examples**
```sql
-- Find names starting with letters A-F but not B or D
SELECT * FROM Customers 
WHERE LastName LIKE '[A-F^BD]%';

-- Find codes where second character is not a vowel
SELECT * FROM Products 
WHERE ProductCode LIKE '_[^AEIOU]%';

-- Exclude specific characters
SELECT * FROM LogEntries 
WHERE Message LIKE '%error[^0-9]%';  -- "error" not followed by a digit
```

## **3. `_` (Single Character Wildcard)**
**Purpose**: Matches exactly one unspecified character.

### **Key Features**
- Similar to `?` in other pattern matching systems
- Often combined with `%` for flexible matching
- Position matters in the pattern

### **Examples**
```sql
-- Find 5-letter names starting with 'J' and ending with 'n'
SELECT * FROM Employees 
WHERE FirstName LIKE 'J___n';

-- Match part numbers with format: AA-999-X (where X is any letter)
SELECT * FROM Inventory 
WHERE PartNumber LIKE '__-___-[A-Z]';

-- Find phone numbers with specific pattern
SELECT * FROM Contacts 
WHERE Phone LIKE '___-___-____';  -- US phone format
```

## **Combined Wildcard Examples**
```sql
-- Find vehicle plates: Letter, not 0-9, then 4 numbers
SELECT * FROM Vehicles 
WHERE Plate LIKE '[A-Z][^0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]';

-- Find usernames: starts with a-d, contains exactly one underscore
SELECT * FROM Users 
WHERE Username LIKE '[a-d]%_%' 
AND Username NOT LIKE '%_%_%';
```

## **Performance Considerations**
1. Wildcards at the **beginning** of patterns (`LIKE '%term'` or `LIKE '_term'`) prevent index usage
2. For complex patterns, consider:
   ```sql
   -- More efficient than multiple LIKE clauses
   WHERE Column LIKE '[ABC]%'
     AND Column LIKE '%[XYZ]'
     AND LEN(Column) BETWEEN 5 AND 10
   ```
3. For case-sensitive matching, specify collation:
   ```sql
   WHERE Username LIKE '[a-z]%' COLLATE SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CS_AS
   ```

## **Comparison of Wildcard Operators**
| Operator | Purpose | Example | Matches |
|----------|---------|---------|---------|
| `[ ]` | Match character set | `[A-C]%` | "Apple", "Banana", "Carrot" |
| `[^ ]` | Exclude character set | `[^0-9]%` | "Alpha", "Beta" (not "1stPlace") |
| `_` | Match any single character | `A_C` | "ABC", "AXC" (not "AC" or "ABBC") |

These wildcard operators provide powerful pattern-matching capabilities for data validation, search functionality, and complex filtering in SQL Server queries.
