# **Operator Precedence in Transact-SQL (SQL Server)**

The **[Operator Precedence (Transact-SQL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/language-elements/operator-precedence-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver16)** article explains how SQL Server evaluates complex expressions by defining the order in which operations are performed when multiple operators appear in a single expression.

## **1. Operator Precedence Hierarchy**
SQL Server evaluates operators in the following order (from highest to lowest precedence):

| Level | Operators | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | `+` (Positive), `-` (Negative), `~` (Bitwise NOT) | Unary operators |
| 2 | `*` (Multiply), `/` (Divide), `%` (Modulo) | Multiplicative |
| 3 | `+` (Add), `-` (Subtract), `+` (Concatenate) | Additive |
| 4 | `=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `<>`, `!=`, `!>`, `!<` | Comparison |
| 5 | `^` (Bitwise XOR), `&` (Bitwise AND), `\|` (Bitwise OR) | Bitwise |
| 6 | `NOT` | Logical NOT |
| 7 | `AND` | Logical AND |
| 8 | `OR`, `ALL`, `ANY`, `BETWEEN`, `IN`, `LIKE`, `SOME` | Logical OR and others |

## **2. Key Concepts**
### **Evaluation Rules**
1. **Higher precedence operators** are evaluated first
2. **Equal precedence operators** are evaluated left-to-right (except assignment operators which are right-to-left)
3. **Parentheses `( )`** override all precedence rules

### **Examples**
```sql
-- Example 1: Arithmetic precedence
SELECT 5 + 2 * 3;    -- Evaluates as 5 + (2*3) = 11 (not 21)

-- Example 2: Logical operator precedence
SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE Salary > 50000 AND Department = 'IT' OR Age < 30;
-- Evaluates as (Salary > 50000 AND Department = 'IT') OR Age < 30
```

## **3. Common Precedence Pitfalls**
### **Arithmetic vs. Bitwise**
```sql
SELECT 5 & 2 * 3;  -- Evaluates as 5 & (2*3) = 5 & 6 = 4
                   -- Not (5 & 2) * 3 = 0 * 3 = 0
```

### **Logical Conditions**
```sql
-- This might not work as intended
WHERE Age > 21 OR Age < 18 AND Status = 'Student'
-- Evaluates as Age > 21 OR (Age < 18 AND Status = 'Student')

-- Correct approach with parentheses
WHERE (Age > 21 OR Age < 18) AND Status = 'Student'
```

## **4. Special Cases**
### **Assignment Operators**
- Have lower precedence than most other operators
- Evaluate right-to-left

```sql
DECLARE @x INT = 5;
SET @x += @x * 2;  -- Evaluates as @x = @x + (@x * 2) = 15
```

### **CASE Expressions**
- Have their own precedence rules
- Evaluated after most other operators

```sql
SELECT CASE WHEN 1 + 2 * 3 = 7 THEN 'Yes' ELSE 'No' END;
-- Evaluates multiplication first: 2*3=6, then 1+6=7 â†’ 'Yes'
```

## **5. Best Practices**
1. **Use parentheses liberally** to make intentions clear
   ```sql
   -- Clearer than relying on precedence
   SELECT (5 + 2) * 3;
   ```
2. **Break complex expressions** into multiple steps for readability
3. **Test edge cases** when combining different operator types
4. **Document non-obvious precedence** in code comments

## **6. Performance Considerations**
- Parentheses don't affect performance (optimizer handles them)
- Complex expressions with many operators might:
  - Reduce readability
  - Occasionally prevent optimal execution plans

## **Complete Evaluation Example**
```sql
SELECT ~1 + 2 * 3 % 4 | 5 & 6 ^ 7;
```
Evaluation order:
1. `~1` (Bitwise NOT)
2. `2 * 3` (Multiplication)
3. `(result) % 4` (Modulo)
4. `(step 1 result) + (step 3 result)` (Addition)
5. `6 ^ 7` (Bitwise XOR)
6. `5 & (step 5 result)` (Bitwise AND)
7. `(step 4 result) | (step 6 result)` (Bitwise OR)

Understanding operator precedence is essential for writing correct T-SQL queries, especially when combining mathematical, logical, and bitwise operations in complex expressions.
