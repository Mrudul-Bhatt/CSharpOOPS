# **Comparison Operators in Transact-SQL (SQL Server) - Part 2**

These additional comparison operators provide alternative ways to express inequality conditions in SQL Server queries.

## **1. `<>` (Not Equal To)**
**Purpose**: Tests whether two expressions are not equal.

**Key Points**:
- Standard SQL operator for inequality
- Returns `TRUE` if values are different
- `NULL` handling: `NULL <> 5` returns `UNKNOWN` (not `TRUE`)

**Examples**:
```sql
-- Find all non-IT departments
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Department <> 'IT';

-- Find products not priced at $19.99
SELECT * FROM Products WHERE Price <> 19.99;
```

## **2. `!=` (Not Equal To)**
**Purpose**: Alternative syntax for `<>` (same functionality).

**Key Points**:
- Non-standard (but widely supported) alternative to `<>`
- Functionally identical to `<>`
- Preference: Use `<>` for better compatibility

**Example**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE Status != 'Inactive';
```

## **3. `!<` (Not Less Than)**
**Purpose**: Tests if the left operand is not less than the right (equivalent to `>=`).

**Key Points**:
- Obsolete operator (use `>=` instead)
- May be removed in future SQL Server versions
- Maintained for backward compatibility

**Example**:
```sql
-- These are equivalent
SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE Total !< 1000;
SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE Total >= 1000;
```

## **4. `!>` (Not Greater Than)**
**Purpose**: Tests if the left operand is not greater than the right (equivalent to `<=`).

**Key Points**:
- Obsolete operator (use `<=` instead)
- Included for backward compatibility
- Not recommended for new code

**Example**:
```sql
-- These are equivalent
SELECT * FROM Products WHERE Price !> 50;
SELECT * FROM Products WHERE Price <= 50;
```

## **Comparison of Operators**

| Operator | Standard | Recommended Alternative | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------------------------|-------|
| `<>` | Yes | - | Preferred inequality operator |
| `!=` | No | `<>` | Non-standard but widely supported |
| `!<` | No | `>=` | Obsolete, avoid in new code |
| `!>` | No | `<=` | Obsolete, avoid in new code |

## **Important Notes**
1. **NULL Handling**: All these operators return `UNKNOWN` when comparing with `NULL`:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM Table WHERE Column <> NULL; -- Returns no rows
   SELECT * FROM Table WHERE Column IS NOT NULL; -- Correct approach
   ```

2. **Performance**: These operators have identical performance to their alternatives:
   ```sql
   -- These queries have identical execution plans
   SELECT * FROM Products WHERE Price <> 100;
   SELECT * FROM Products WHERE Price != 100;
   ```

3. **Readability**: Standard operators (`<>`, `>=`, `<=`) are generally preferred:
   ```sql
   -- More readable than !< and !>
   WHERE Price >= 100  -- Clear intent
   WHERE Price !< 100  -- Less intuitive
   ```

## **Practical Recommendations**
1. Always use `<>` instead of `!=` for better compatibility
2. Replace `!<` with `>=` and `!>` with `<=` in all new code
3. For `NULL` checks, always use `IS NULL` or `IS NOT NULL`

**Example Migration**:
```sql
-- Old style (discouraged)
SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE Total !< 1000 AND Status != 'Completed';

-- New style (recommended)
SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE Total >= 1000 AND Status <> 'Completed';
```

These operators complete the set of comparison operations in T-SQL, though some are maintained primarily for backward compatibility with older code.
