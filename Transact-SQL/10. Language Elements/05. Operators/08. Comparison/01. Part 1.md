# **Comparison Operators in Transact-SQL (SQL Server)**

These operators compare two expressions and return a Boolean result (`TRUE`, `FALSE`, or `UNKNOWN`). They're fundamental for filtering data in `WHERE`, `HAVING`, and `JOIN` clauses.

## **1. `=` (Equals)**
**Purpose**: Tests for equality between two expressions.

**Key Points**:
- Returns `TRUE` if values are equal
- For `NULL` comparisons, use `IS NULL` instead
- Case-insensitive for strings unless collation is case-sensitive

**Examples**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Department = 'IT';
SELECT * FROM Products WHERE Price = 19.99;
```

## **2. `>` (Greater Than)**
**Purpose**: Checks if the left operand is greater than the right.

**Key Points**:
- Works with numeric, date, and string (alphabetical) data types
- For strings, comparison follows collation order
- `NULL` comparisons return `UNKNOWN`

**Examples**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE OrderDate > '2023-01-01';
SELECT * FROM Students WHERE Score > 90;
```

## **3. `<` (Less Than)**
**Purpose**: Checks if the left operand is less than the right.

**Key Points**:
- Opposite of `>` operator
- For dates, earlier dates are considered "less"

**Examples**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Products WHERE Price < 100;
SELECT * FROM Events WHERE StartTime < GETDATE();
```

## **4. `>=` (Greater Than or Equal To)**
**Purpose**: Checks if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right.

**Key Points**:
- Inclusive version of `>`
- Useful for range queries

**Examples**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Salary >= 50000;
SELECT * FROM Tasks WHERE DueDate >= CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;
```

## **5. `<=` (Less Than or Equal To)**
**Purpose**: Checks if the left operand is less than or equal to the right.

**Key Points**:
- Inclusive version of `<`
- Often used with `BETWEEN` for range checks

**Examples**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE Age <= 30;
SELECT * FROM Inventory WHERE Quantity <= ReorderLevel;
```

## **Comparison Rules Summary**

| Operator | Name | Returns TRUE When | NULL Handling |
|----------|------|-------------------|---------------|
| `=` | Equals | Values are equal | `NULL = NULL` → `UNKNOWN` |
| `>` | Greater Than | Left > Right | `NULL > 5` → `UNKNOWN` |
| `<` | Less Than | Left < Right | `NULL < 5` → `UNKNOWN` |
| `>=` | Greater Than or Equal | Left ≥ Right | `NULL >= 5` → `UNKNOWN` |
| `<=` | Less Than or Equal | Left ≤ Right | `NULL <= 5` → `UNKNOWN` |

## **Important Notes**
1. **NULL Behavior**: Any comparison with `NULL` returns `UNKNOWN`, which is treated as `FALSE` in `WHERE` clauses.
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM Table WHERE Column = NULL; -- Won't work
   SELECT * FROM Table WHERE Column IS NULL; -- Correct
   ```

2. **Data Type Precedence**: SQL Server implicitly converts data types following precedence rules:
   ```sql
   SELECT 5 > '3'; -- Converts '3' to INT (works)
   SELECT '5' > 3; -- Converts '5' to INT (works)
   ```

3. **String Comparisons**: Depends on collation settings:
   ```sql
   -- Case-sensitive comparison
   SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Username = 'Admin' COLLATE SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CS_AS;
   ```

4. **Performance Impact**: These operators can use indexes when applied to indexed columns:
   ```sql
   -- Efficient with proper index
   SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE OrderDate >= '2023-01-01';
   ```

## **Practical Examples**

**1. Range Query**:
```sql
SELECT ProductName, Price
FROM Products
WHERE Price >= 10 AND Price <= 100;
```

**2. Date Filtering**:
```sql
SELECT OrderID, OrderDate
FROM Orders
WHERE OrderDate >= '2023-01-01'
AND OrderDate < '2024-01-01';
```

**3. String Matching**:
```sql
SELECT FirstName, LastName
FROM Employees
WHERE LastName >= 'M' AND LastName < 'N';
```

These comparison operators form the foundation of SQL filtering logic and are essential for querying specific data subsets efficiently.
