# **Logical Operators in Transact-SQL (SQL Server) - Part 2**

These operators provide powerful pattern matching, list comparison, and logical negation capabilities in SQL Server queries.

## **1. `IN`**
**Purpose**: Tests if a value matches any value in a list or subquery.

**Key Points**:
- Equivalent to multiple `OR` conditions
- Works with literal lists or subqueries
- More readable than multiple `OR` clauses
- Subquery must return a single column

**Examples**:
```sql
-- Literal list
SELECT * FROM Products WHERE CategoryID IN (1, 3, 5);

-- Subquery
SELECT * FROM Customers 
WHERE CustomerID IN (SELECT CustomerID FROM Orders WHERE Total > 1000);
```

**NULL Handling**:
- `NULL IN (1, 2, NULL)` returns `UNKNOWN` (not `TRUE`)

**Performance Tip**:
- For large lists, temporary tables often outperform long `IN` lists

## **2. `LIKE`**
**Purpose**: Pattern matching with wildcards.

**Key Points**:
- Wildcards:
  - `%` = any string of zero or more characters
  - `_` = any single character
  - `[]` = any single character within the range/set
  - `[^]` = any single character not within the range/set
- Case sensitivity depends on collation

**Examples**:
```sql
-- Names starting with 'A'
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE LastName LIKE 'A%';

-- Phone numbers with area code 415
SELECT * FROM Contacts WHERE Phone LIKE '415%';

-- Exactly 5 characters starting with 'S'
SELECT * FROM Products WHERE ProductCode LIKE 'S____';
```

**Escape Character**:
```sql
-- Search for literal '%'
SELECT * FROM Logs WHERE Message LIKE '%\%%' ESCAPE '\';
```

## **3. `NOT`**
**Purpose**: Negates a Boolean expression.

**Key Points**:
- Can be combined with other operators (`NOT IN`, `NOT LIKE`, etc.)
- Returns `TRUE` if expression is `FALSE`, and vice versa
- `NULL` input returns `NULL`

**Examples**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Products WHERE NOT Discontinued;

SELECT * FROM Orders 
WHERE NOT OrderDate BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-01-31';
```

**Truth Table**:
| Expression | NOT Expression |
|------------|----------------|
| TRUE | FALSE |
| FALSE | TRUE |
| NULL | NULL |

## **4. `OR`**
**Purpose**: Logical disjunction (returns TRUE if either condition is TRUE).

**Key Points**:
- Short-circuits: Stops evaluation if first condition is `TRUE`
- Lower precedence than `AND` (use parentheses to control order)
- Can significantly impact query performance

**Example**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers 
WHERE State = 'CA' OR State = 'NY' OR State = 'TX';
```

**Truth Table**:
| A | B | A OR B |
|---|---|--------|
| T | T | T |
| T | F | T |
| F | T | T |
| F | F | F |
| T | NULL | T |
| NULL | T | T |

## **5. `SOME` | `ANY`**
**Purpose**: Compare a value to any value in a subquery (functionally identical).

**Key Points**:
- `SOME` and `ANY` are synonyms
- Returns `TRUE` if any comparison is `TRUE`
- Often used with comparison operators (`>`, `<`, `=`, etc.)

**Examples**:
```sql
-- Products priced higher than SOME products in Category 2
SELECT * FROM Products
WHERE Price > SOME (SELECT Price FROM Products WHERE CategoryID = 2);

-- Equivalent using ANY
SELECT * FROM Products
WHERE Price > ANY (SELECT Price FROM Products WHERE CategoryID = 2);
```

**Difference from `IN`**:
- `IN` only checks equality (`=`), while `SOME`/`ANY` work with other operators

## **Performance Considerations**
1. **`IN` vs `OR`**:
   - For small lists, `IN` is cleaner
   - For large lists, consider temporary tables

2. **`LIKE` Patterns**:
   - Leading wildcards (`%text`) prevent index usage
   - `text%` can use indexes

3. **`NOT` Impact**:
   - `NOT IN` and `NOT EXISTS` often have different performance characteristics
   - With nullable columns, `NOT IN` can produce unexpected results

4. **`OR` Alternatives**:
   - For column-level `OR`, consider `UNION ALL` for better performance

## **Practical Examples**
### **Combining Operators**
```sql
-- Active customers in specific states who haven't ordered recently
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Status = 'Active'
AND (State IN ('CA', 'NY', 'TX'))
AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM Orders 
               WHERE Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID
               AND OrderDate > DATEADD(month, -6, GETDATE()));
```

### **Advanced `LIKE` Usage**
```sql
-- Find product codes matching pattern: A-C, then 3 digits, then X-Z
SELECT * FROM Products
WHERE ProductCode LIKE '[A-C]___[X-Z]';
```

### **`SOME` with Different Operators**
```sql
-- Employees earning more than SOME managers
SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE Salary > SOME (SELECT Salary FROM Employees WHERE Title LIKE '%Manager%');
```

These logical operators provide the foundation for building complex filtering conditions in SQL Server queries, enabling precise data retrieval and manipulation.
