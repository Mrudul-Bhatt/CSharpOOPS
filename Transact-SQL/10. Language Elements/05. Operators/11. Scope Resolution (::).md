# **Explanation of ":: (Scope Resolution) (Transact-SQL)" in Microsoft Docs**

The **`::` (Scope Resolution)** operator in SQL Server is a specialized syntax used exclusively with **built-in system statistical functions**. This operator provides direct access to SQL Server's internal performance counters without requiring the standard function call syntax.

## **1. Purpose and Usage**
The scope resolution operator allows you to:
- Access SQL Server's **system statistical functions** directly
- Retrieve real-time server performance metrics
- Use these functions as if they were column values

## **2. Supported Functions**
Only these specific system statistical functions work with `::`:

| Function | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `::CONNECTIONS` | Number of login attempts | `SELECT ::CONNECTIONS` |
| `::CPU_BUSY` | CPU time in milliseconds | `SELECT ::CPU_BUSY` |
| `::IDLE` | Server idle time in ms | `SELECT ::IDLE` |
| `::IO_BUSY` | I/O operation time in ms | `SELECT ::IO_BUSY` |
| `::PACK_RECEIVED` | Network packets received | `SELECT ::PACK_RECEIVED` |
| `::PACK_SENT` | Network packets sent | `SELECT ::PACK_SENT` |
| `::PACKET_ERRORS` | Network packet errors | `SELECT ::PACKET_ERRORS` |
| `::TOTAL_READ` | Physical disk reads | `SELECT ::TOTAL_READ` |
| `::TOTAL_WRITE` | Physical disk writes | `SELECT ::TOTAL_WRITE` |
| `::TOTAL_ERRORS` | Disk read/write errors | `SELECT ::TOTAL_ERRORS` |

## **3. Syntax**
```sql
::function_name
```
- No parentheses required
- Can be used in SELECT statements like a column

**Example**:
```sql
SELECT 
    ::CONNECTIONS AS LoginAttempts,
    ::CPU_BUSY AS CPUMilliseconds,
    ::TOTAL_READ AS PhysicalReads
```

## **4. Key Characteristics**
1. **No Parameters**: These functions don't accept any parameters
2. **System-Level Metrics**: Return values since SQL Server last started
3. **Requires Permissions**: Typically needs `VIEW SERVER STATE` permission
4. **Not for User-Defined Functions**: Only works with specific system functions

## **5. Comparison with Standard Function Calls**
| Approach | Example | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| **Scope Resolution** | `SELECT ::CONNECTIONS` | Special syntax for system stats |
| **Regular Function** | `SELECT CONVERT(INT, @@CONNECTIONS)` | Standard approach for most functions |

## **6. Practical Examples**

### **Monitoring Server Activity**
```sql
-- Get basic server activity metrics
SELECT 
    ::CONNECTIONS AS TotalLogins,
    ::CPU_BUSY/1000.0 AS CPU_Seconds,
    ::IO_BUSY/1000.0 AS IO_Seconds,
    ::TOTAL_READ AS DiskReads,
    ::TOTAL_WRITE AS DiskWrites
```

### **Calculating Utilization Percentages**
```sql
-- Calculate CPU utilization percentage
DECLARE @msSinceStart INT = DATEDIFF(ms, sqlserver_start_time, GETDATE()) 
FROM sys.dm_os_sys_info;

SELECT 
    (::CPU_BUSY * 100.0 / @msSinceStart) AS CPU_Utilization_Pct
```

## **7. Important Notes**
1. **Not a General Scope Operator**: Unlike C++'s `::`, this is only for specific system functions
2. **Counters Reset**: Values reset when SQL Server restarts
3. **Alternative Views**: Consider `sys.dm_os_performance_counters` for more detailed metrics
4. **Deprecation Warning**: Some sources suggest this syntax may be deprecated in favor of DMVs

## **8. Permission Requirements**
```sql
GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO [YourLogin];
```

## **When to Use**
- Quick server health checks
- Embedded in monitoring scripts
- When you need lightweight performance metrics without querying DMVs

## **Alternatives**
For more comprehensive monitoring, use:
- Dynamic Management Views (DMVs)
- System stored procedures (`sp_monitor`)
- SQL Server Agent alerts

This specialized operator provides a concise way to access critical server metrics, though modern monitoring typically uses the more extensive DMV infrastructure.
