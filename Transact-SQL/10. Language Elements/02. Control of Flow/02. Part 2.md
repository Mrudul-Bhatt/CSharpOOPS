Hereâ€™s a **deep dive** into the last four **control-of-flow language elements** in Transact-SQL, along with detailed explanations and examples.

---

## **1. WAITFOR**
- **Purpose:** Delays execution for a specified time or until an event occurs.
- **Syntax:**
  ```sql
  WAITFOR { DELAY 'hh:mm:ss' | TIME 'hh:mm:ss' }
  ```
- **Behavior:**
  - `DELAY` â†’ Waits for a specified duration.
  - `TIME` â†’ Waits until a specific time.
- **Example Usage:**
  ```sql
  -- Wait for 5 seconds before executing the next statement
  WAITFOR DELAY '00:00:05';

  -- Wait until 10:30 AM before executing the next statement
  WAITFOR TIME '10:30:00';
  ```
- **Use Case:** Helps in **throttling execution** and **waiting for external processes**.  
- **More details:** [Microsoft Docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/language-elements/waitfor-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver16)

## **2. WHILE (and CONTINUE)**
- **Purpose:** Executes a loop while a condition is `TRUE`.
- **Syntax:**
  ```sql
  WHILE boolean_expression
  BEGIN
      sql_statement
  END
  ```
- **Behavior:**
  - `WHILE` â†’ Runs a loop until the condition is `FALSE`.
  - `CONTINUE` â†’ Skips the remaining statements in the loop and starts the next iteration.
- **Example Usage:**
  ```sql
  DECLARE @Counter INT = 1;

  WHILE @Counter <= 5
  BEGIN
      PRINT 'Iteration: ' + CAST(@Counter AS NVARCHAR(10));
      
      IF @Counter = 3
          CONTINUE; -- Skips the rest of the loop for iteration 3
      
      SET @Counter = @Counter + 1;
  END;
  ```
- **Use Case:** Helps in **batch processing and automation**.  
- **More details:** [Microsoft Docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/language-elements/while-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver16)

## **3. BREAK**
- **Purpose:** Exits a `WHILE` loop immediately.
- **Syntax:**
  ```sql
  BREAK;
  ```
- **Behavior:**
  - Stops execution of the loop and moves to the next statement after `END`.
- **Example Usage:**
  ```sql
  DECLARE @Counter INT = 1;

  WHILE @Counter <= 10
  BEGIN
      PRINT 'Iteration: ' + CAST(@Counter AS NVARCHAR(10));

      IF @Counter = 5
          BREAK; -- Exits the loop when Counter reaches 5
      
      SET @Counter = @Counter + 1;
  END;
  ```
- **Use Case:** Useful for **stopping execution when a condition is met**.  
- **More details:** [Microsoft Docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/language-elements/break-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver16)

## **4. GOTO**
- **Purpose:** Transfers control to a labeled statement.
- **Syntax:**
  ```sql
  label:
  GOTO label;
  ```
- **Behavior:**
  - Skips all statements between `GOTO` and the label.
  - Can be used **inside procedures or batches**.
- **Example Usage:**
  ```sql
  PRINT 'Step 1';
  GOTO SkipStep;
  
  PRINT 'Step 2'; -- This will be skipped
  
  SkipStep:
  PRINT 'Step 3';
  ```
- **Use Case:** Helps in **jumping to specific execution points**, though **not recommended** for modern SQL practices.  
- **More details:** [Microsoft Docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/language-elements/goto-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver16)

### **Key Takeaways**
- **WAITFOR** delays execution **for a duration or until a specific time**.
- **WHILE (and CONTINUE)** executes **loops with conditional logic**.
- **BREAK** exits **loops immediately**.
- **GOTO** jumps **to labeled statements**, though **not recommended**.
