### **Understanding `async` and `await`**

The `async` and `await` keywords are foundational to asynchronous programming in C#. They simplify writing non-blocking, asynchronous code. Here's a breakdown of their purpose and usage:

* * * * *

### **1\. Capabilities of `async`**

When you use the `async` modifier in a method, it enables the following:

### **a. Use of `await` in the Method**:

-   The `await` keyword designates **suspension points** in the method.
-   At an `await` point:
    -   The method is suspended and control returns to the caller.
    -   The method doesn't exit; it pauses execution and resumes when the awaited task is complete.

### **b. Can Be Awaited by Callers**:

-   A method marked with `async` can be awaited by its caller.
-   This allows chaining of asynchronous operations.

* * * * *

### **2\. Behavior of Suspension**

-   **Suspension â‰  Exit**:
    -   When an `async` method is suspended at an `await` point, it **does not exit**. Control simply returns to the caller, and the method continues from where it left off once the awaited task completes.
-   **Finally Blocks Don't Run on Suspension**:
    -   Because the method doesn't exit, `finally` blocks are **not triggered** at suspension points. They run only when the method exits completely.

* * * * *

### **3\. Methods Without `await`**

-   An `async` method **typically contains one or more `await` operators**, but this is not mandatory.
-   If there are no `await` points:
    -   The method executes **synchronously**.
    -   The compiler **issues a warning**, as using `async` in such cases is unnecessary.

* * * * *

### **4\. `async` and `await` Are Contextual Keywords**

-   **Contextual Keywords**: They have special meaning only in certain contexts (e.g., inside an `async` method). Outside of such contexts, they can be used as identifiers.

* * * * *

### **Usage and Examples**

### **Basic Example**:

```
public async Task<string> FetchDataAsync()
{
    using var client = new HttpClient();

    // Suspension point
    string data = await client.GetStringAsync("<https://example.com>");

    return data;
}

// Caller
public async Task ProcessDataAsync()
{
    string data = await FetchDataAsync();
    Console.WriteLine(data);
}

```

### **Synchronous-Like Execution Without `await`**:

```
public async Task<int> GetValueAsync()
{
    // No 'await', executes synchronously
    return 42;
}

```

-   This would issue a **compiler warning** since the `async` modifier isn't needed.

### **Using `await` for Real Suspension**:

```
public async Task<int> DelayedValueAsync()
{
    await Task.Delay(1000); // Suspension point
    return 42;
}

```

* * * * *

### **Advantages of `async` and `await`**

1.  **Non-Blocking Code**:
    -   Applications remain responsive, as the thread isn't blocked during suspension points.
2.  **Simplified Asynchronous Programming**:
    -   The syntax resembles synchronous code, making it easier to read and maintain.
3.  **Improved Scalability**:
    -   Multiple tasks can run concurrently without consuming threads unnecessarily.

* * * * *

### **Key Points to Remember**

-   **`async` Modifier**:
    -   Declares that a method is asynchronous.
    -   Allows use of `await` within the method.
-   **`await` Operator**:
    -   Marks a suspension point.
    -   Tells the method to pause execution until the awaited task completes.
-   **Return Types**:
    -   `async` methods typically return `Task`, `Task<TResult>`, or `void` (for event handlers).
-   **Compiler Behavior**:
    -   The compiler transforms async methods into state machines to handle suspensions and continuations.
