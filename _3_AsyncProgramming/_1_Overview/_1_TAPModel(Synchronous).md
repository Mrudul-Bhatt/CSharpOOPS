### **The Task Asynchronous Programming (TAP) Model: A Walkthrough**

### **Overview**

The Task Asynchronous Programming (TAP) model in .NET allows developers to write asynchronous code that looks and
behaves like synchronous code. It simplifies the complexity of asynchronous programming by enabling sequential-looking
code while allowing non-blocking execution.

### **Synchronous Code Example: Cooking Breakfast**

In the provided code, breakfast preparation is written synchronously. Each step blocks the program until it is complete
before moving on to the next step.

### **Code Explanation:**

1.  **Sequential Execution:**

    Each method (`PourCoffee`, `FryEggs`, etc.) completes fully before the next method is called. For example:

    ```
    Coffee cup = PourCoffee();
    Console.WriteLine("coffee is ready");

    Egg eggs = FryEggs(2);
    Console.WriteLine("eggs are ready");

    ```

    This approach makes the program easy to follow, but inefficient. Tasks like frying eggs or toasting bread involve
    waiting for a specific duration, during which the program is idle.

2.  **Blocking Operations:**

    Methods like `Task.Delay(3000).Wait();` simulate waiting by blocking the thread for 3 seconds. During this time, no
    other task can execute on the thread.

3.  **Total Time Taken:**

    Since tasks are performed one after the other, the total time is the sum of all the task durations. This results in
    inefficiency and cold breakfast!

### **Challenges with Synchronous Code:**

1.  **Performance Bottlenecks:**

    The thread is blocked during each delay. This wastes computing resources and increases execution time.

2.  **Poor User Experience:**

    In UI applications, synchronous operations can make the interface unresponsive, causing the application to "freeze."

3.  **Scalability Issues:**

    On servers, synchronous code limits the number of requests the server can handle since threads are blocked
    unnecessarily.

### **Asynchronous Programming: Cooking Breakfast Efficiently**

To optimize breakfast preparation, tasks that can run independently should execute asynchronously. For example, you can
start toasting bread while frying eggs.

---

### **Asynchronous Code Example**

Here's how the same breakfast preparation could be written using async/await:

```
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace AsyncBreakfast
{
    internal class Bacon { }
    internal class Coffee { }
    internal class Egg { }
    internal class Juice { }
    internal class Toast { }

    class Program
    {
        static async Task Main(string[] args)
        {
            Coffee cup = PourCoffee();
            Console.WriteLine("coffee is ready");

            var eggsTask = FryEggsAsync(2);
            var baconTask = FryBaconAsync(3);
            var toastTask = MakeToastWithButterAndJamAsync(2);
            Juice oj = PourOJ();
            Console.WriteLine("oj is ready");

            Egg eggs = await eggsTask;
            Console.WriteLine("eggs are ready");

            Bacon bacon = await baconTask;
            Console.WriteLine("bacon is ready");

            Toast toast = await toastTask;
            Console.WriteLine("toast is ready");

            Console.WriteLine("Breakfast is ready!");
        }

        private static Juice PourOJ()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Pouring orange juice");
            return new Juice();
        }

        private static async Task<Toast> MakeToastWithButterAndJamAsync(int slices)
        {
            Toast toast = await ToastBreadAsync(slices);
            ApplyButter(toast);
            ApplyJam(toast);
            return toast;
        }

        private static void ApplyJam(Toast toast) =>
            Console.WriteLine("Putting jam on the toast");

        private static void ApplyButter(Toast toast) =>
            Console.WriteLine("Putting butter on the toast");

        private static async Task<Toast> ToastBreadAsync(int slices)
        {
            for (int slice = 0; slice < slices; slice++)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Putting a slice of bread in the toaster");
            }
            Console.WriteLine("Start toasting...");
            await Task.Delay(3000);
            Console.WriteLine("Remove toast from toaster");

            return new Toast();
        }

        private static async Task<Bacon> FryBaconAsync(int slices)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"putting {slices} slices of bacon in the pan");
            Console.WriteLine("cooking first side of bacon...");
            await Task.Delay(3000);
            for (int slice = 0; slice < slices; slice++)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("flipping a slice of bacon");
            }
            Console.WriteLine("cooking the second side of bacon...");
            await Task.Delay(3000);
            Console.WriteLine("Put bacon on plate");

            return new Bacon();
        }

        private static async Task<Egg> FryEggsAsync(int howMany)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Warming the egg pan...");
            await Task.Delay(3000);
            Console.WriteLine($"cracking {howMany} eggs");
            Console.WriteLine("cooking the eggs ...");
            await Task.Delay(3000);
            Console.WriteLine("Put eggs on plate");

            return new Egg();
        }

        private static Coffee PourCoffee()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Pouring coffee");
            return new Coffee();
        }
    }
}

```

### **Key Features of Asynchronous Code:**

1.  **`Task` and `async` Methods:**

    Methods like `FryEggsAsync` return a `Task<Egg>`, representing ongoing work.

2.  **`await` Keyword:**

    - Suspends execution of the current method until the awaited `Task` is complete.
    - Frees up the thread to execute other work during the delay.

3.  **Concurrent Execution:**

    Tasks like frying eggs, cooking bacon, and toasting bread start concurrently. The program only waits when results
    are needed (e.g., `await eggsTask`).

4.  **Efficient Resource Utilization:**

    No thread is blocked during asynchronous delays (`await Task.Delay`).

---

### **Benefits of Asynchronous Programming:**

1.  **Faster Execution:**

    Independent tasks run concurrently, reducing total time.

2.  **Improved Scalability:**

    Threads aren't blocked, allowing more tasks to run concurrently.

3.  **Better User Experience:**

    UI applications remain responsive while performing background work.

4.  **Easier to Read:**

    Unlike traditional asynchronous models (e.g., callbacks), `async`/`await` provides a clear, sequential flow.

### **Comparison: Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Breakfast**

| **Aspect**          | **Synchronous**             | **Asynchronous**                      |
| ------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Execution Time**  | Total of all task durations | Shorter; tasks overlap.               |
| **Code Simplicity** | Easy to read and follow.    | Slightly more complex but manageable. |
| **Thread Blocking** | Blocks threads.             | Threads remain free.                  |
| **Performance**     | Inefficient.                | Highly efficient.                     |
