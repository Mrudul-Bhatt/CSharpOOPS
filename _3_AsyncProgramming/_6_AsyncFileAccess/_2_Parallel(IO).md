### **Parallel Asynchronous I/O**

Parallel asynchronous I/O in C# allows multiple file operations to be performed simultaneously, maximizing throughput and efficiency. This approach is especially useful for scenarios involving numerous independent I/O tasks, such as reading or writing multiple files.

* * * * *

### **Key Concepts**

1.  **Parallel Processing**:
    -   Multiple file operations are initiated concurrently rather than sequentially.
    -   This improves performance by utilizing I/O resources more efficiently.
2.  **Asynchronous Processing**:
    -   Reduces thread usage and prevents blocking, especially in UI applications or high-concurrency server environments.
3.  **Task Management**:
    -   Each I/O operation returns a `Task` representing its progress.
    -   `Task.WhenAll` ensures that the program waits for all tasks to complete before proceeding.

* * * * *

### **Examples**

### **Simple Parallel Write Example**

This example writes text to 10 files in parallel using `File.WriteAllTextAsync`.

```
public async Task SimpleParallelWriteAsync()
{
    string folder = Directory.CreateDirectory("tempfolder").Name;
    IList<Task> writeTaskList = new List<Task>();

    for (int index = 11; index <= 20; ++index)
    {
        string fileName = $"file-{index:00}.txt";
        string filePath = $"{folder}/{fileName}";
        string text = $"In file {index}{Environment.NewLine}";

        // Add the asynchronous write task to the list
        writeTaskList.Add(File.WriteAllTextAsync(filePath, text));
    }

    // Wait for all tasks to complete
    await Task.WhenAll(writeTaskList);
}

```

-   **Steps**:
    1.  Creates a directory `tempfolder`.
    2.  Iterates to generate file names and writes to each file asynchronously.
    3.  Collects all `Task` objects in `writeTaskList`.
    4.  Waits for all tasks to complete using `Task.WhenAll`.

* * * * *

### **Finite Control Example**

This example offers finer control by using `FileStream` and `WriteAsync`, ensuring that all file streams are properly closed after the tasks are complete.

```
public async Task ProcessMultipleWritesAsync()
{
    IList<FileStream> sourceStreams = new List<FileStream>();

    try
    {
        string folder = Directory.CreateDirectory("tempfolder").Name;
        IList<Task> writeTaskList = new List<Task>();

        for (int index = 1; index <= 10; ++index)
        {
            string fileName = $"file-{index:00}.txt";
            string filePath = $"{folder}/{fileName}";
            string text = $"In file {index}{Environment.NewLine}";
            byte[] encodedText = Encoding.Unicode.GetBytes(text);

            // Create a FileStream for writing
            var sourceStream = new FileStream(
                filePath,
                FileMode.Create, FileAccess.Write, FileShare.None,
                bufferSize: 4096, useAsync: true);

            // Start writing asynchronously
            Task writeTask = sourceStream.WriteAsync(encodedText, 0, encodedText.Length);

            // Keep track of the FileStream and task
            sourceStreams.Add(sourceStream);
            writeTaskList.Add(writeTask);
        }

        // Wait for all tasks to complete
        await Task.WhenAll(writeTaskList);
    }
    finally
    {
        // Ensure all FileStreams are closed
        foreach (FileStream sourceStream in sourceStreams)
        {
            sourceStream.Close();
        }
    }
}

```

-   **Steps**:
    1.  Creates a directory `tempfolder`.
    2.  Iterates to generate file names and writes to each file using `FileStream` and `WriteAsync`.
    3.  Adds each `FileStream` to `sourceStreams` to ensure they can be closed later.
    4.  Waits for all tasks using `Task.WhenAll`.
    5.  Closes all `FileStream` objects in the `finally` block to avoid resource leaks.

* * * * *

### **Advantages**

1.  **Performance Boost**:
    -   Writing files in parallel speeds up the process when multiple files need to be written simultaneously.
2.  **Efficient Resource Use**:
    -   Asynchronous methods don't block threads during I/O operations, freeing them for other tasks.
3.  **Scalability**:
    -   Reduces the number of threads needed, making applications more scalable for large workloads.

* * * * *

### **Cancellation Support**

Both `WriteAsync` and `ReadAsync` methods support `CancellationToken`, which allows you to cancel ongoing I/O operations if needed. This is useful for scenarios where user interaction or application state might require stopping long-running tasks.

Example with CancellationToken:

```
public async Task ProcessWriteWithCancellationAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken)
{
    string filePath = "file.txt";
    string text = "Hello, this operation may be canceled!";
    byte[] encodedText = Encoding.Unicode.GetBytes(text);

    using var sourceStream = new FileStream(
        filePath,
        FileMode.Create, FileAccess.Write, FileShare.None,
        bufferSize: 4096, useAsync: true);

    await sourceStream.WriteAsync(encodedText, 0, encodedText.Length, cancellationToken);
}

```

* * * * *

### **Considerations**

1.  **Proper Resource Management**:
    -   Always ensure streams are closed or disposed of properly to prevent resource leaks.
    -   Use `finally` blocks or `using` statements for cleanup.
2.  **Task Completion**:
    -   Ensure all tasks are awaited to avoid incomplete operations or runtime errors.
3.  **Thread Safety**:
    -   Parallel operations should handle separate files to avoid race conditions or corruption.

* * * * *

By implementing parallel asynchronous I/O, you can significantly improve the performance and scalability of applications dealing with large numbers of independent file operations.
